            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Publick <hi>ſpirit</hi> is a rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit, honour'd of GOD, eſteem'd of Man; its a <hi>piece</hi> of GOD in Man, or Man ſeeking himſelfe in GOD. Its a ſpirit above the world, becauſe above it ſelfe. We reade of many of the Heathens, who were renowned for their publickneſſe of ſpirit. And certainely it was an excellent ſpirit which was in them, but it was ſhort of the true ſpirit: it held forth a god, though it fell below the true God; Publickneſſe of ſpirit <hi>ſpeaks</hi> a god, when privateneſſe of ſpirit makes it ſelfe a god. Its proper alone to God to work from himſelfe, and to himſelf, to be the <hi>ſpring</hi> whence, and the <hi>ſea</hi> whither all his actions tend; but it is not for man. He that makes himſelfe the <hi>principle</hi> of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:64789:3"/>and the <hi>end</hi> of working; that (like a circular line) begins from himſelf, and ends in himſelfe, doth pull downe God, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe in Gods ſtead. Like the <hi>ſpark</hi> in the fire, or the <hi>drop</hi> in the ſea; ſo our good doth more conſiſt in God then in our ſelves. He that ſeeks to be <hi>ſomething</hi> out of God, begins to be nothing; but he that can be <hi>nothing</hi> for God, findes himſelfe <hi>all</hi> in God, and God <hi>all</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Right honourable, among thoſe who have <hi>excelled</hi> in this publickneſſe of ſpirit in our dayes. And have <hi>ſought God</hi> and the good of theſe <hi>bleeding</hi> kingdomes, in ſeparation, nay in oppoſition to themſelves; we finde your Honour in the front, uncorruptedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right—And it is but a <hi>manifeſt</hi> of your ancient ſpirit in former times, when not many durſt; and few would appeare, to own <hi>religon</hi> under contempt, we have had bad <hi>dayes</hi> before, then <hi>dayes</hi> of ſin, now <hi>dayes</hi> of trouble; and theſe <hi>dayes</hi> of trouble, they are but the <hi>births</hi> of thoſe dayes of ſin. Then you were a <hi>patron</hi> to the good, now a <hi>patriot</hi> to the whole. In the former you were a <hi>ſhelter</hi> in theſe a <hi>Saviour;</hi> before a <hi>ſuccour</hi> to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, now an <hi>aſſertor</hi> of it. In which worke, your honour hath had a part <hi>burthenſome</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but ſuitable to the greatneſſe of your
<pb facs="tcp:64789:3"/>ſpirit, fitted to <hi>incounter</hi> with difficulties: you have laine at the breaches; ſeen the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God in the deepe, beene the terror of the ſea, the comfort of the land: and we have therefore been ſo ſecure at land, becauſe our hearts have ſecurely repoſed in you at ſea: Your worke is great, but your rewards are glorious; the hardeſt ſervices ſhall have the beſt rewards: nay, is there not ſomething of a reward in this? that God will own us, that God will honour us to worke for him. My Lord I know your head and hands are full, yet give me leave in this preſſe of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to preſent to your honour the ſtate of our Church under the notion of <hi>A toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhip upon a ſtormy ſea making to ſafe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor:</hi> under that notion theſe poor thoughts may finde acceſſe to you, and come under your honours protection. The Ship is the Church of God, the Sea the world, the the contrary windes, men of contrary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the ſtorme, our preſent troubles, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding precious, religion, property, liberty, and what ever is deare; the paſſengers, our ſelves, the harbour which we make towards, is nothing but peace with reformation. The windes have been and do continue high, the ſea ſtormy, our dangers great, and we have been forced to caſt much of our lading over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
<pb facs="tcp:64789:4"/>to preſerve the reſt, and ſave the ſhip. In theſe our ſtraits many diſtruſting the ſafety of the ſhip, have let down a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, and ſought to ſhift for themſelves; Some ſinfully, all ſhamefully; others who ſee their good folded up in the whole, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to out-live their precious lading, do ſtill abide in the ſhip: ſome labouring at the ſterne, others at the oare; every one their hands full.—But though our work is hard, our dangers great, yet is it not with us, as with the Apoſtle, paſt all hopes of ſaving, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.20. There is yet hope if we looke downward, we are not yet ſo low as to hope againſt hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. If we were, yet there is hope in the God of hope. And indeed there is our ſtay, we have anchord too much downward, we have reſted upon that which by very reſting upon hath proved uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and unprofitable to us: diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhame are the deſerved ends of creature truſts: oh that wee could now anchor upwards! upon that <hi>GOD</hi> who is the Rocke of Ages, an everlaſting rock; a rock ſo deep that no floods can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, &amp; ſo high that no waves can reach. This is our comfort in our ſtraits and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles here below, that there is yet ſea-roome enough in the infinite goodneſſe of God for
<pb facs="tcp:64789:4"/>faith to be carried full ſaile upon. Nothing ſhould poſe our faith, but what poſeth God: Nothing is too big for God to do; and why ſhold any thing be too big for us to believe? Things marvellous to us, are yet eaſie with God; things wonderfull to us are yet fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with him, as he tels us <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.6.—It is our hope that <hi>God</hi> is riſen, nay, gone forth, and is now travelling in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength to bring redemption to his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to work deliverances for his people. Let us ſtand and admire him in his going forth: <hi>Loe this is our God! we have waited for him and he will ſave us: this is the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay 25:9.</note> 
               <hi>we have waited for him, and we will be glad in his ſalvation:</hi> Let us put our ſelves into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture fit to receive mercy, and then <hi>ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of our God:</hi> ſtand ſtill in believing, yet indeavour in working; we are to fix our eyes, but uſe our hands. <hi>Through God we ſhall doe valiantly,—for he ſhall tread downe all our enemies</hi> for us. We, <hi>but wee through God</hi>—It is the ſpeech of one, Uſe means as if there were not a God to helpe, look up to God as if not a man to help. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not to uſe meanes is to tempt God, and to truſt in meanes is to provoke God. It is a leſſon worth learning, not to ſwell in the injoyment, nor to ſink in the want of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:64789:5"/>reliefes, to be nothing in our ſelves in the preſence of meanes, and to be all in God in the abſence of them. But let me not be a burthen to your honour in the entrance.— My Lord, I have only this to ſay; you have done much for God, and God hath now put advantages into your hands of doing more; it will be your honour here,

Certainly no — Thus I have ſhewed thee the many Springs and Sources of Englands ſorrows; And now, in what readineſſe we are for the removing of them, I dare not thinke! posſibly, ſomething may be done; nay probably, much may be done, but the hearts of the people, not being yet prepared, doth give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect (though the indeavors of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be never ſo ſincere, ſo full) yet our plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will not be large enough to our ſoar; Theſe are our ſad thoughts; But Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts; It is eaſie with him to Purge his Worſhip, to fence his Ordinances, to bring his Goſpel into eſteeme.

            <p>The Diſciples went, but they had their warrant, they had the word of Chriſt to provoke them to it, and incourage them in it. The like had <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, &amp;c.</hi>

The Diſciples met with ſtormes, but Chriſt leaves them not in the ſtorm; their obedience to Chriſt, brought the preſence of Chriſt to them. Never man wanted comfort long, that went in a way of obedience. The Martyr went far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meer obedience, but before he came to the journies end, before he came to the ſtake, God gave him

But ſhould thou dye without comfort, thou dyeſt in the ſhip, and not in the ſea, thou dyeſt in Gods way, and there is ſafety, though thou never reach the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>

            <p>We are ſometimes troubled at the want of means for the bringing of a work about, how ſhall this thing be? but if the work be Cods, he will want no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the effecting of it: Nay in the want of all he can work alone.

            <p>But further. <hi>(To get into a ſhip.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we are to do Gods work, we are not to have our tooles to ſeeke; the ſhip was ready when they had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go to ſea.

            <p>Here is a plaine proofe againſt the <hi>Vbiquitarians,</hi> who hold Chriſts body, his humane nature to be in all places. And here is alſo the errour of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation confuted, who take away the dimenſions of a body, making the body of Chriſt in ſo many places as bits of bread at the ſame time: if Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature had beene in every place, Chriſt could not have ſaid, Goe before him to the other ſide.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething more in it. <hi>[Goe before him.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you read before, you ſhall ſee the occaſion of Chriſts withdrawing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his Diſciples was the newes of <hi>Johns</hi> beheading. They had told him that <hi>Herod</hi> had beheaded <hi>John</hi>

            <p>It ſuits well with Chriſts love to his Church, and his end of comming into the world, to take more care to preſerve them, then to ſave himſelfe, to looke to their ſafety more then his owne. You know what he ſaid, John 18.8. <hi>If you ſeek me let theſe go free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee came to interpoſe himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64789:19"/>God and us, he came to beare our ſcourges to undergoe our ſtripes. As <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> to ſaid <hi>Iacob:</hi> on thee my ſon be the bleſſing, on me be the curſe. So Chriſt to us, like <hi>Ionah,</hi> he was content to be caſt into the ſea, even the ſea of wrath, that there might be a calme, a peace between God and man: he came not to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but to be our Saviour, and therefore was content to loſe himſelf that he might ſave us; to undergoe all, that we might be free.</p>
            <p>We are more deere to Chriſt, then he was to himſelf; &amp; therefore he doth here, as we do whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things are in danger, ſeek to preſerve that which we eſteeme moſt, which is moſt precious to us; to ſave us was more deſirable to Chriſt, then to preſerve himſelfe. He ſees himſelfe in us, oh that we could ſee our ſelves in God, and that the preſervation of the glory of Chriſt might be more in our eyes, then the ſaving of our ſelves. As Chriſt was more tender of us then he was of himſelfe; ſo let us be more tender of his glory, then of our own ſafety: if we can but hold up his glory, though we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in his glory, yet we ſhall be glorified.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This ſeemes to be another reaſon why he ſent his Diſciples before him;
<note place="margin">Aliquantiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per detinuit, donec preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re juſsit.

And the day was farre ſpent, the night was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on, the ſhip was going, for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it was a paſſengers ſhip; ſhould they have ſtayed till Chriſt had diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, the ſhip might have been gone.</p>
            <p>And therefore while Chriſt was ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude away, he conſtrained his Diſciples to take the opportunity and go before him. The words may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a reaſon of Chriſts ſtay behinde, and of ſending the Diſciples before.</p>
            <p>But yet that which is expreſſed was the leaſt of the reaſons wherefore Chriſt diſmiſſed them. You may ſee greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than that in the hiſtory. 1. Becauſe he would goe to pray: 2. Becauſe hee would now exerciſe the graces of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples alone: 3. Becauſe he had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſcover his divine power in their deliverance.</p>
            <p>But this may be one: while he ſent the multitude away:</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64789:21"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That though a bare command of God be ſufficient to challenge our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it, yet ſo graciouſly doth God often condeſcend to our weakneſſe, as to give us a reaſon of impoſing of it.</p>
            <p>It was ſo here, hee doth not onely command his Diſciples to goe before him, but gives them a reaſon why he doth.</p>
            <p>Indeed when God commands, it is the reaſon of reaſons to obey, becauſe God commands. The commands of God, though they may bee above reaſon, yet they are not contrary to right reaſon. The obedience of faith, is farre above reaſon, but it is not againſt reaſon, becauſe it is all reaſon to believe what God ſaith, and to obey what God commands.</p>
            <p>In obedience to man, we are to look for a reaſon of obedience, or a rule of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is according to right reaſon.</p>
            <p>It is to put off man, and to diveſt our ſelves of reaſon, to obey againſt reaſon. As the Pope who commanded the Monk to goe and water a dry ſtake for three yeares together morning and evening.

            <p>If God doe not diſcover himſelfe to you, yet if God do further diſcover your ſelves to your ſelves; it is worth the while of wayting upon God.</p>
            <p>It is good to be in Gods way: the blind man found this to be true, who lying in the way where Chriſt came, was cured of his blindnes, and recovered his ſight.

            <p>Here is a multitude here this day, if your hearts be right, know this, Chriſt will not ſend you away without ſome refreſhment.</p>
            <p>Had he reſpect to the bodies of men, when a multitude were come together, that he would not ſend them away after their long continuance with him in his Ordinances, without ſome refreſhment, leſt they fainted in the way; certainely he will have more regard to the ſoules of men: What are the faintings of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to the faintings of the ſoule?</p>
            <p>But further—<hi>[While he ſent the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude away.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be here demanded, why Chriſt ſhould ſend them away? had it not been better for them to have continued with Chriſt, to have followed him in his temptations, to havn attended upon him in the work of his Miniſtery; why doth he ſend them away?</p>
            <p>There is good reaſon:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He would not over-drive them, hee would not continue their exerciſes above their ſtrength, he would lay no more wood on than there was fire able to kindle, hold them no longer in duties than there was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64789:24"/>ſtrength to carry them on. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his pace, becauſe of the weakneſſe of his little ones, Chriſt proportions the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of duty, to the ſtrength of the people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or ſecondly, Chriſt ſends them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, would not ſuffer them to continue and goe with him, becauſe he would not put them to difficulties, above their ſtrength to goe through: he knew, if they were to follow him, they might quickly be weary:
<note place="margin">8 Matth. 20.</note> for the foxes had holes, and the birds of the ayre had neſts, but the ſonne of man hath no place where to lay his head.</p>
            <p>When the children of Iſrael came out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> God would not lead them by the way of the hills, which was the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way, but by the way of the plaines, which was much about. And upon this ground, becauſe of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> leſt the difficulties they met withall in their firſt ſetting out, might diſcourage them, and make them think of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes again to <hi>Egipt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon the ſame ground God doth ſpare men for a time in the wayes of grace, and doth not exerciſe vong begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as hee doth thoſe who are growne
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64789:24"/>Chriſtians. Till the Diſciples were got from the ſhore, till they were got to the midſt of the ſea, they met with no ſtorms. As I ſhall ſhew, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Or elſe Chriſt would have them now go home, having fed their bodies, and refreſhed their ſoules, to meditate upon thoſe things which they had heard.</p>
            <p>One Sermon wrought downe to the Spirit, is worth many heard: too many who are great feeders,
<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

This is not to feed upon Sermons, but to devoure Sermons, when they are not digeſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nouriſhment: our nouriſhment doth not ſo much lye in feeding, as in dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. You may by that increaſe the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your heads, your knowledge; but not nouriſh the leanneſſe of your hearts, your affections. It is monſtrous in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to have the head bigger then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo in grace, to increaſe knowledge only, and not practiſe. If all time were ſpent in feeding, where were the time for working? you feed, to work.</p>
            <p>Your preſent affections that are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; raiſed in hearing, wil vaniſh &amp; fall againe, if you do not work all downe in meditation, and digeſt them into your
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64789:25"/>nature, or your nature into them, the good word; whereby the ſtocke chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the nature of it. Too many that neglect the hearing of the word at all, and ſome that think that this is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, when this is but a preparatory ſervice, a ſervice ſubſervient to another; hearing to obeying, preaching to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. I will not caſt water upon your affections, quench any ſpark of Gods kindling:
<note n="b" place="margin">Folia haec ſunt non fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.

            <p n="4">4. There may be another reaſon yet, why Chriſt ſent them away; that they ſhould now go about their lawfull occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, take care of their families, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit their relations, make their houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds better for that they had received. Two things hence obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The duties of our generall calling; though they are far to be preferred, yet they muſt not altogether juſtle out the duties of our particular. Chriſt ſends them away to their homes after he had refreſhed them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Abſolute duties towards God, muſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64789:25"/>quicken us to, and in our relative duties towards man.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> when he had beene converſing with God, that he plucked up his feet, and went cheerefully on in his way.</p>
            <p>The duties of godlineſſe are no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but a furtherance to us, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablement of us in our particular duties towards man. When we have beene with Chriſt in a day, we muſt labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home better husbands, better wives, better parents, better children, &amp;c. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute duties towards God, muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to, and inable us in our relative du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards man.</p>
            <p>After Chriſt had been in the Temple, ſaith the Text, he went home, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient to his parents; the being in the Temple was no cauſe why Chriſt was obedient: it is ſaid after, not by way of cauſality, but in order of time. But our being with God, and converſes with him, do inable us to performe theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to man which God requires. So much for the 22 Verſes.</p>
            <p>We come to the next.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Verſe. <hi>And when he had ſent the multitude away, he went into a Mountaine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64789:26"/>to pray, and when the evening was come, he was then alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here now appeares one great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Chriſt diſmiſſed his Diſciples, and the multitude, concealed before, he went to pray. You have three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The order, when he had ſent the multitude away.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The place, he went into a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The end, to pray.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[When he had ſent the multitude away.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt Chriſt diſmiſſeth the multitude, and then goes to be alone, Chriſt had no need of his helpe:
<note n="c" place="margin">Ipſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus non la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boravit illo vitio, ut avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentis vel impediretur, vel langueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret illius o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio ſicutnos, &amp; tamen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis in exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum ſeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum quaerit. Chem. in. loc.</note> he could be alone when he was in company, he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God without diſtractions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinfull or naturall. But this Chriſt did to teach us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That when we are to have to do with God, to diſmiſſe the multitude, you are to diſcharge your ſelves of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of your affaires, the multitude of your imployments, cares, thoughts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If you diſmiſſe not theſe before you enter the duty, you will find they will be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64789:26"/>like the birds to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that will eat up and devoure your ſpirituall ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Men cannot doe their owne work in a crowd of people, nor Gods, in a crowd of thoughts.</p>
            <p>Diſcharge your thoughts. It is unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have your tongues converſing with God, and your ſpirits converſing with the world. But we come to the ſecond. The place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[He went into a Mountaine.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Mountaine. That's high above theſe cumbrances here below; and its ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Chriſt choſe it, he deſired to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and choſe a Mountaine for the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt place.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64789:27"/>to the inventions of men, to ſharpen and quicken our devotions. Thoſe cannot be good affections, which are either kindled or blowne up by the meanes of our devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and not of Gods commanding.</p>
            <p>Of theſe kindes are our ſignificant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as themſelves call them; the whiteneſſe of the Surplice was to put you in mind of the purity of the Church, and to ſtirre up our affections after the deſire of purity. The decking of Altars, the coping of Miniſters, the pargelling of wals, the painting of the windowes with Moſaical deviſes, the uſe of Organs, &amp;c. were all ſet up and inſtituted of men, for this end, as they ſay, to quicken the dull affections of man. But being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant from God, they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſuperſtitions of men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fleſh, too ſhort to beget, kindle, or fewell, any ſpirituall and holy affections.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſame ground the Papiſts have the uſe of Images, Crucfixes in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſtirre up and quicken their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bee incentives of worſhip: theſe are condemned, and how can the other be allowed, when both plead the ſame ends, and are ſet up on the ſame grounds.</p>
            <p>Aſſure your ſelves, will-worſhip, in

This people draw neare with their lips, but their hearts are farre from me. And why ſo? he gives the reaſon; their feare towards mee is taught by the precepts of men.</p>
            <p>We ſay the greater the body, the leſſe is the ſpirit of a man: So the greater the body and bulke of humane ceremonies, the leſſe is the life and ſpirit of true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God will only blow with his own bellowes, worke with his owne tooles, &amp; not by inſtruments, and ways of our deviſing. And though our adverſaries have caſt us out with ſcorne, as thoſe in 66. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 5.

            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That when wicked men ſtretch forth their hand againſt the Church of God, it is high time to get into a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to pray.</p>
            <p>When the Enemie comes in like a flood, ſtrongly, ſwiftly, &amp;c. then ſhould the Spirit of the Lord lift up a Standard againſt them, that is, ſay ſome, powre out their ſoules in prayer; to repell their violence and put them to flight.</p>
            <p>Then ſhould we ſay, <hi>We lift up our eyes to the hils, whence comes our helpe; our help ſtands in the name of the Lord, who made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64789:30"/>Heaven and Earth.</hi> You know this hath ever beene the Churches practiſe, and ſhould be ours.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why we get no more into the Mountaine, it is becauſe we have, and make Mountaine of our own: we reſt in the arme of fleſh. We have been ready to ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7. <hi>I ſhall never be moved, thou haſt made my mountaine ſo ſtrong.</hi> Marke you there; <hi>David</hi> had a Mountaine, and it was ſtrong; and though he acknowledged it was all from God, for he ſaith, <hi>Thou hast made my Mountaine ſo ſtrong;</hi> yet he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in it, as appeares after by Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of him; <hi>thou hidſt thy face, and I was troubled:</hi> and now his Mountain was nothing. We have had means, and thoſe meanes of Gods gracious beſtowing. We acknowledge that God hath made our mountaine ſtrong, it is all from God, that ſtrength and concurrence we have: but yet for all this we reſt upon our mountaine, and not upon God.</p>
            <p>And this is our way to turn our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into a Mole-hill, this is the way to turne our ſtrength into weakneſſe, and to make thoſe things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> otherwiſe would be uſefull to us, to be unuſefull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64789:30"/>
            <p>This is one ground, why we go no more into the Mountaine, why we are no more in prayer; becauſe our Mountaine is ſo ſtrong, becauſe we reſt upon the means afforded to us. <hi>Davids</hi> Mountain might have ſtrengthned his faith, but his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine becomes his faith and confidence.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad thing, when that meanes which ſhould quicken our hearts to ſeek, doth dead our hearts in ſeeking: and that which ſhould incourage us to truſt in him, doth take off our hearts from depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him. This is the cauſe, why God doth often leſſen our mountain, that he might increaſe our faith, and deprive us of other comforts, that he might be all our confidence: weaken the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of fleſh that hee might ſtrengthen the arme of faith.</p>
            <p>God often makes us fatherleſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of creature reliefes, that we might be fatherleſſe in reſpect of creature reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. God blaſts that meanes whereon we doe relye, that he might be the alone relyance of his people; he makes us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that we might be all in him, and ſtrengthen our ſelves in God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The argument of Chriſts prayer may be gheſſed at, if you look forward upon what followes.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64789:31"/>
            <p>The Diſciples were ſent to ſea, Chriſt foreſees the ſtorme, he would not hinder it,
<note n="a" place="margin">Tempeſtas haec non for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuito exorta, ſed divinitus immiſſa, ut fides navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantium ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erceretur. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus.</note> but ſuffers it for the exerciſe of their graces. Yet he gets into a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to pray, and no doubt for them, that in this exerciſe of their faith, their faith might not faile them. As he prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> when Sathan deſired to winnow him, that his faith might not faile him: if not, Sathan had not only winnowed him like wheat, but blowne him away like chaffe. So Chriſt doth here pray for his Diſciples, that in this great exerciſe, in this great ſtorme, their faith might not faile them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That in all our difficulties and troubles,
<note place="margin">Praevidit Chriſtus fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem eam non praevenit ſua omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, ſed ſe convertit ad praeces, ne in tempeſtuoſo mari pereant, neve ipforum fides, quae tempeſtate il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la probanda erat, deficiat.

            <p>He is gone to Heaven for this end, and this is his worke in Heaven. If Chriſt had not ſent ſuccours from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the ſea, they had not only beene toſſed, but drowned; not only exerciſed, but deſtroyed. So, if Chriſt did not pray for us in our troubles, temptations, no affliction but would be too big for our little hearts.</p>

            <p>And here our Evangeliſt ſaith, when the evening was come, Chriſt was in the mountaine alone, ſo that there ſeemes ſome ambiguity. But this difficulty is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64789:32"/>cleared, if we doe conſider the Jewes had two evenings.

            <p>And thus we then reconcile this ſeeming difference. The Diſciples went to Sea in the firſt evening, which was about 3. a clock.

            <p>And in the ſecond evening Chriſt was in the mountaine, and they in the midſt of the Sea: in the very nick of time, when they were in their danger, Chriſt was in the mountaine interceding for them. From this appearing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence wee are taught to compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to acquaint our ſelves with the cuſtome of the Jewiſh nation.</p>
            <p>Ignorant men look upon many places of Scripture, perhaps to them at the firſt view they do appear like <hi>Ptlates</hi> ſervants accuſing Chriſt, none of them in the ſame tale, one contradicting another: but if wee looke throughly on them, wee ſhall ſee them like <hi>Nathen</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> both

            <p>
               <q>[He was there alone.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it might be ſaid the Diſciples were alone, they were now in the middeſt of the Sea, a ſtorme is riſen, they are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with waves, in the darke of the night, and Chriſt was abſent too. Here was an alone indeed. Thoſe muſt neede bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who have not Chriſt with them, though they enjoy ever ſo many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts. But what were they that were ſeparated from all, and Chriſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent too? It may bee ſaid they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>But how can Chriſt be ſaid to be alone? can hee whoſe abſence makes us alone, though we have all the comforts and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours in the world, and whoſe preſence makes all, in the want of all, can hee bee ſaid to be alone?</p>
            <p>We are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt,

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64789:33"/>on the ſea; his preſence fills hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</item>
                  <item>2. In reſpect of his humane nature, Chriſt in ſome reſpects might be ſaid to be alone.

            </p>
            <p>In the two former reſpects, Chriſt could not be ſayd to be alone, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo alone in the ſaddeſt houre, he never wanted comfort, never aſſiſtance. As he himſelfe ſaith, 16. Joh. 22. <hi>The houre will come, and now is, when you ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, every one to his owne houſe, and ſhall leave me alone, and yet I am not alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Father is with me.</hi> Hee was with him to comfort him, to ſupport him in the darkeſt houre. Indeed he trod the Wine-preſſe of his Fathers wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, 63. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3. Alone if you looke downward, hee had no comfort, no aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from man, no not their company, all left him. But not alone, if you look upward; He had the ſupports of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was heard in that thing hee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64789:33"/>feared. And what ever hee had in that diſmall black houre, that houre of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as hee himſelfe calls it, when hee was to conflict with the wrath of God, to wraſtle with the terrours of Death, the the powers of Darkneſſe, yet afterward heaven miniſtred to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But alone in reſpect of company, ſo Chriſt might be, and ſo Chriſt was here: And ſo hee ſaid hee was in that 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 32. When yet in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he ſaid he was not alone.</p>
            <p>So Chriſt was here alone. Hee that is all was now alone. The Diſciples were gone to ſea, the multitude were diſmiſſed to their homes, and Chriſt was here alone. It tells us this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctr.</hi> That Chriſtians are to ſeeke and take occaſions to bee alone: if you would not bee alone in reſpect of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, you muſt ſeek to be alone in reſpect of company. The way not to be alone,
<note place="margin">1 Matth. 39.</note> is to be alone.
<note n="a" place="margin">Nunquam minus ſolus quam tum ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> Chriſtians are never leſſe alone, than when they are alone. It a ſad thing to be alone in reſpect of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſo Gods people have bin by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to be alone, in reſpect of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany; Gods withdrawing from us, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the chaſtiſements of our with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64789:34"/>from God. Gods people have been alone in reſpect of comfort, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alone in reſpect of aſſiſtance. His grace ſhall be ſufficient for you. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men they are alone indeed, alone in the abundance of all things, they are without God in the world, without Chriſt, without the Spirit; and woe be to them who are ſo alone; though theſe things may doe ſomething to beare up their Spirits, and hold them up by the Chin here for a time, yet they will leave them, or they ſhall them, and then they ſhall know what it is to bee alone. But we muſt leave them, either to ſeek God to be their God, their company here, or to know the miſery of the want of him hereafter.</p>
            <p>We proceed: for as yet we are but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſhore: Let us lance forth into the deep, and now haſten to the Diſciples who were alone indeed.</p>

                  <item>3. Alone in reſpect of company, for all were in the ſame condition with them, they may bee ſaid to bee alone in

Sometimes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would let them go; ſometimes he repented, &amp; recalled them,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64789:36"/>their cruell uſage was increaſed, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>At laſt, when God by a ſtrong hand brought them out of Egypt, you ſee what difficulties they met withall at the Red Sea, and after in the wilderneſſe, hunger, thirſt, drought, fiery Serpents, &amp;c. And when they vvere to enter into Canaan, vvhat oppoſition did they meet withall,

               <hi>Doct.</hi> That comfortable and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beginnings, may yet afterward finde ſad and ſorrow full proceedings.</p>
            <p>It was ſo here, the Diſciples had a proſperous and promiſing ſetting forth, but afterwards they met with ſtormes.</p>
            <p>The ſtories of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the deliverance of Iſrael out of Egypt, and of the Jewes ſecond building of the Temple, tell us this plainly, they had promiſing begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; inſomuch, that they thought the work would have been done out of hand:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64789:39"/>but the ſtories tell you what obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whar interruptions they met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, before the worke was finiſhed, &amp;c. Though the clauſes and concluſions of Gods people are good, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Mark the upright man, obſerve the just, for the end of that man is peace;</hi> yet the beginnings and the proceedings may be ſad and troubleſome. Though God will bring the ſhip of his Church to ſafe harbour at the laſt, yet they may meet with ſtormes and tempeſts on the ſea.

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> This doth admoniſh us to beware of vaine and fleſhy confidence, becauſe of promiſing beginnings;
<note n="n" place="margin">Neſcis qusd ſerus veſper vehit.</note> The fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt morning may be over-caſt, the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt day may bee over-clouded, the moſt promiſing beginnings, may meet with ſad and ſorrow full proceedings.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is a great argument of lightneſſe and vanity of ſpirit, yea and of carnall fleſhy confidence, to bee puffed up upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64789:40"/>promiſing beginnings; a thing the world is apt to: but when God ſees his owne people in the ſame way, they muſt then expect that God ſhould hedge up their way with thornes, and lay unpaſſible mountaines of difficulty in their way.</p>
            <p>The caſe ſeems to bee ours, it lookes like it.</p>
            <p>Had not our ſhip, in which was imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much of our good and happineſſe, a proſperous gale at their firſt ſetting forth? had they not a proſperous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? did they not a long time goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contrary wind, without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? had they not the Prayers, the deſires, the countenance, and well-wiſhes of all to carry them on? were not the beginnings very comfortable, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promiſing? you all know. But how have they met with contrary winds? ſad proceedings! what difficulties, what mountaines of difficulties have they met withall in the carrying on of this work? you all know.</p>
            <p>The caſe is ours: what muſt be the cure? what is our work now in rhis caſe?</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is ſomething that wee muſt not doe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is ſomething that muſt bee done.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:64789:40"/>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt not be diſcouraged. God is able to make theſe troubles that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen in the way, to help forward his own end. Doe the billowes riſe, let the Ark, let the ſhip riſe with them: do the winds blow, let them but kindle and inflame your zeale and courage.</p>
            <p>Aſſure your ſelves, God will both bee your Pilot in the ſhip, and your defence on the Sea; That which you carry ſhall never miſcarry; nay it ſhal be your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too:

            <p>And therefore bee not diſcouraged, though ſtormes ariſe, though the flouds of ungodlineſſe doe lift up their voyce, he that ſits in heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorne; and he that ſits at the ſterne will bring all ſafe to harbour at laſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are not to forgoe the cauſe. This were to forſake the Arke becauſe the waves and billowes riſe, to jump into the Sea, becauſe the wind blowes, the Sea is, ſtormy.</p>
            <p>You ſee the Diſciples they did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ſhip becauſe of the ſtorme.</p>
            <p>Nor did any of them let down a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, and labour to ſecure themſelves.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Search out the cauſe, why God hath obſtructed our promiſing, and hopefull beginnings. Is there not ſome <hi>Ionah</hi> that lyeth under Deck as yet aſleep, ſome ſin unſeen, unhumbled for? Is there not ſome old ſins, that God comes now to reckon for? old ſins raiſe new ſtormes; former ſins a preſent tempeſt. See what ſin is the cauſe, the Jewes in every judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was inflicted on them, did uſe to ſay that God weighed out an ounce of the golden Calfe to them. Though an old ſin, yet they ſaw God might reckon with them for it. And there ſeems ſomething to bee implyed that ſpeakes for theſe thoughts, hee is ſaid to forgive, yet hee would remember them at the time of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, 31 <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>Is there not ſome <hi>Achan,</hi> ſome wedge of Gold, ſome Babaloniſh garment, that hath thus diſturbed our proſperous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings? Have not ſome freſh iſſues of luſt and corruption broken forth now in the expectation of healing?</p>
            <p>Have we not been unthankfull for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull under all the incomes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of mercy?</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64789:42"/>
            <p>Did we not grow ſecure, proud, ſelfe-confident upon the hopes of mercy and deliverance?</p>
            <p>What is that hath cauſed God to ſtrew our wayes with difficultie? to hedge up our way with thornes, to increaſe our throwes, to multiply our pangs, when the children were brought to the birth, when in our thoughts deliverance was ſo neare?</p>
            <p>Secondly, when you have found it out be humbled for it.</p>
            <p>You have an advantage this day unto theſe duties, ſuch a one as our fathers never injoyed.
<note n="y" place="margin">An ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the ſolemn humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our ſoules for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinall ſins.</note> You have here ſent you a liſt of the ſins the nation is guilty of; and there is nothing required of you, but that you ſhould lay them to heart this day, that God may never lay them to your charge.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the day-ſtarre, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger of mercy to us: As the Apoſtle ſaith of another duty, it is the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement with promiſe. So this, it is one of the firſt duties that ſpeakes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, not to perſons onely, but to the whole nation. Oh that we could in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt this day draw water as out of a well
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64789:43"/>and poure it forth before the Lord.</p>
            <p>A floud of teares would now prevent a deluge of wrath: Nationall repentance might yet procure a nationall pardon, if we have once made our peace with God, then will not God onely be at peace with us, but cauſe our very enemies to bee at peace with us alſo.</p>
            <p>This is a ſoul-humbling, a ſoul-afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. Other dayes are humbling dayes, this is a heart-breaking day; other dayes are afflicting dayes; this ſhould be a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melting day; oh that <hi>Englands</hi> teares might prevent <hi>Englands</hi> bloud!</p>
            <p n="3">3. When you have found out the cauſe, &amp; humbled your ſelves for it, your next work is to reforme it.</p>
            <p>What is it to lament ſin,
<note n="z" place="margin">Non nocent praeterita pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata, ſi non placent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fentia, Aug.</note> if you doe not leave ſin? what were it to weep our eyes out of our heads, if we doe not weep our ſins out of our heaats?</p>
            <p>It is not humiliation is enough, nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and ſupplication, unleſſe to theſe you joyne reformation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7 14. <hi>If my people ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turne from their evell wayes, then will I heare from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he mercifull to their ſins, and heale their land.</hi> Marke you, it is not one of theſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64789:43"/>but all of them: the words are not to be read diſjunctively, as if one would ſerve the turn, but copulatively, all or nothing.</p>
            <p>You read this in 10. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. &amp;c. that Iſrael humbled themſelves &amp; prayed too, yea and prayed earneſtly, but for all this, God was giving them up into the hand of their enemies, till they ſet upon the work of reformation too, as you ſee 15, 16 verſes, and then the Lord was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the miſery of Iſrael.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be mighty in prayer with God this day. Mighty neceſſities doe cal for migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrivings &amp; wreſlings with God. Theſe are ſpeciall times of ſeeking.</p>
            <p>And ſpecial times of ſeeking, ſhould be times of ſpeciall ſeeking of God: But ſeek him humbly, ſeek him fervently, ſeek him cordially, &amp;c. And God will be better to us than our prayers; he will doe for us above what we aske, or think.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Enter into ſolemne Covenant with God againſt them. This is the great duty of the day, and proper for it, when you have bin humbled for them, then covenant againſt them. But be ſure you covenant with God, as he doth with you, that is, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him in Chriſt, deſire him to be ſurety for thee, otherwiſe thy bond is nothing worth.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64789:44"/>
            <p>There is yet another thing obſervable from the time of their danger. It is not preſently upon their ſetting forth, they had for ſome time a proſperous voyage, but now the ſtorme ariſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That God doth not uſe to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſuch as are but young beginners with difficulties.</p>
            <p>I told you in the beginning: it is ſaid of the children of Iſrael when they came out of Egypt, that God would not lead them by the way of the hils, though the neareſt way, but by the way of the plains, though much about; and he himſelfe gives this reaſon. Becauſe of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims: that is, leſt the difficulties they met withall at their firſt ſetting out, might have diſcouraged and diſheartned them in the way.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that he ſlackned his pace becauſe of his little ones: God will not over-drive his people, and put them to exerciſes above the ſtrength of grace received. Upon this ground is that ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Old bottles will not beare new wine,</hi> &amp;c. That is, he would not exerciſe young beginners with auſterities of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but would forbeare them till they had gotten more ſtrength: the dayes will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64789:44"/>come when the bridegroome ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, &amp; then they ſhould faſt, when the bridegrome was taken away: he will then give them in thoſe dayes a more plentifull and abundant meaſure of his ſpirit, and then they ſhould be able for theſe works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> And what a comfort is this to the Saints, though God do exerciſe you, yet he will not put you to exerciſes above the meaſure of grace received.</p>
            <p>You doubt now, how you ſhall be able to undergoe difficulties for Chriſt, how you ſhall lye in priſon, how dye for Chriſt, and you perplex your hearts with this from day to day; you ſeare if you ſhould be called upon difficulties, you would recoyle and fall back, you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to go through ſuch conditions.</p>
            <p>And indeed thoſe of Gods ſouldiours which have beene moſt fearfull in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have been moſt valiant in the field; thoſe who have ſuſpected their hearts moſt, who have been moſt humble, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and jealous of themſelves, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt reſolute and valiant when God hath called them upon ſervice. Where others who have been ſelfe confident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have ſhrunk in the dayes of tryall.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64789:45"/>As the ſtory of Dr. <hi>Pendleton</hi> will tell you, who when <hi>Saunders</hi> a Miniſter came to him and told him his feares, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of his own heart to undergo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, to burne for Chriſt, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he would rather loſe every drop of greaſe he had, being fat, then deny Chriſt, but yet the poor man ſtood to it, when he renounced it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But beſides, take this for thy comfort, in the middeſt of thy jealous and miſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoughts, that either God will not bring thee upon trials, upon ſufferings, or if he do, he will give thee ſtrength to go through them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though I would have thee to maintaine an humble jealous feare, ſuch a feare as makes thee go out of thy ſelfe, yet beware of ſinking diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging feares, ſuch as diſ-inable for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: ſeeing God hath undertaken, if he call thee forth upon difficulties, to give thee a ſpirit &amp; ſtrength to walk through them.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the ſecond particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the time of their danger. We now come to the third. The danger it ſelfe. And that is ſet out in four particulars.</p>
            <list>

            </list>
            <p>We will begin with the firſt. They were in the midſt of the ſea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[But the ſhip was now in the</hi>

               <hi>midſt of the ſea.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were two great ends for which Chriſt ſent his Diſciples to ſea.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To exetciſe their graces. 2 To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his power. And the middeſt of the ſea was the fitteſt place for theſe: Chriſt choſe the middeſt of the ſea, as the fitteſt place to exerciſe their graces and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his own power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That when Chriſt doth intend to exerciſe the graces of his people, hee plucks them from the ſhore, he brings them into the deep. You ſee here,
<note place="margin">Nihil niſi pontus &amp; aether.</note> Chriſt ſuffered them to be pulled from the land on one ſide, and a contrary wind to blow on the other ſide:

                  </gap>.</note> ſo that they were now in the midſt of the ſea: and here he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth them, when faith hath nothing to do but look upwards, when none but God to relye upon, then it looks fully and reſts firmely upon him. Faith cannot act till it act alone.</p>
            <p>When men are in the deepe, there is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64789:46"/>no way but to caſt anchor upwards, there is no bottome, but in heaven, which is the beſt bottome, when it is the only bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>We ſay the Loadſtone will not draw while the Adamant is neare it, nor faith reſt fully on him, while it hath depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies here below.
<note n="b" place="margin">Optimi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus cum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmi ſumus.</note> Its hard to make that man all in God, who is ſomething in any thing here below.</p>
            <p>The reliefes of creatures do often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us in our relyance upon God: and therefore God is forced to weaken the arme of fleſh, that he might ſtrengthen the arme of faith.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9. 1 Tim. 5.5.

            </p>
            <p>It was that which God ſaid, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I will leave in the midſt of thee a poore diſtreſſed people, and they ſhall trust.—</hi> Therefore doth God break in pieces the reeds whereon we leane, that we might reſt our ſelves upon the rock, himſelfe, who is the rock of ages: a rock ſo deepe, that no flouds can undermine, and ſo high that no waves can reach.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64789:46"/>
            <p>And there are three main reaſons why God when he doth intend to exerciſe the graces of his people; doth pluck them from the ſhore, bring them into the deep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. That he may the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his owne wonders,
<note n="d" place="margin">Deus angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtias ſuorum auget, ut eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fidem probaret, &amp; ſuam vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem declaret, Janſen.</note> we reade in the 107 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23, 24. That <hi>thoſe who goe downe to theſea in ſhips, that do buſineſſe in great waters, theſe ſee the works of the Lord, his wonders in the deep.</hi> It is true in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſenſe. The deepe is a fit place for God to do wonders in, and that he might declare his wonders he brings us into the deepe.</p>
            <p>There are the wonders of foure Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which God declares to them whom he brings into the deep.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He doth declare the wonders of his power: in rebuking the ſtormes, laying the tumultuous rage of the proud waves.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He declares the wonder of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in finding a way to helpe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſuch ſtraights, the Lord knowes how to deliver his.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He declares the wonders of his truth and faithfulneſſe in ſupporting of us, in relieving of us, that we are not ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of the waves: as he promiſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>When you paſſe through the water, I will
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64789:47"/>be with you, that the flouds ſhall not drowne you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 He declares the wonders of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in delivering of us, who when we are at the end of our thoughts, and know not what to do, yet he knowes how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his people.</p>
            <p>None know how powerfull, how wiſe, how faithfull, how mercifull God is, ſo well as thoſe who are brought into deeps, theſe have experience of all God.</p>
            <p>And that God might declare his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, therefore doth he bring his people into the deepe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe this is the fitteſt place for the tryall and diſcovery of what is in our hearts, both for matter of ſinne and grace.</p>
            <p>As God led his people forty yeares through the barren wilderneſſe, to prove them,
<note place="margin">Deut. 8.16.17.</note> and diſcover what was in their hearts: as he tels us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16, 17.</p>
            <p>So God doth ſtill lead his people through a ſea, through a wilderneſſe, through many ſtraits, and great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the ſame end, to diſcover what is in their hearts; both for matter of ſinne and grace.</p>
            <p>Firſt; For matter of ſin. The deepe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64789:47"/>will try us, will diſcover the depth of our hearts, ſuch corruptions as our falſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing hearts will not diſcover, while we are on the ſhore, will be now diſcovered when wee are brought into the deepe.</p>
            <p>Then will your pride, your infidelity, your impatiency, &amp;c. diſcover it ſelfe: while nature is pleaſed, while all things go well with us, corruptions lye hid:
<note n="e" place="margin">Natura vexata, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſe ipſam.</note> but when nature is provoked, when God brings us into the deepe, theſe toſſings will diſcover our hearts.</p>
            <p>You know when God brought <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> into the deepe, upon thoſe ſad tryals and exerciſes; it put them to the utmoſt of their faith and patience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and be quiet, though the one was a mirour of faith, &amp; the other of patience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to diſcover, what is in our hearts for matter of grace.</p>
            <p>A counterfeit piece will ſhew as well as the beſt, till it come to the touchſtone, but the touchſtone quickly diſcovers.</p>
            <p>There are three great graces which are tryed to the back in difficulties; for the tryall of which, God doth often bring us into the deepe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>You are in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through many temptations, that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64789:48"/>tryall of your faith might be found to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ay of God.</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Deus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando ſuos in periculo relinquit, ut ſuas vires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periantur.</note> It is no tryall of faith when all things ſmile upon us, when God, when conſcience, when the world, when friends and all ſmile, that there is not ſo much as the leaſt wrinkle upon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<note n="g" place="margin">Permittit Chriſtus ſuos quandoque adverſis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtatibus jactari, ut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des eorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploretur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitas diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae noſtrae ſe probet, &amp;c. Parous.</note> But now when God frowns when the world frownes. When a man ſhall be brought into the deepe; 1 either the depths of deſertion, or 2 the depths of temptation, or 3 the depths of outward trouble; here is the tryall of faith indeed.</p>
            <p>When a man is cleane plucked from the ſhoare, and hath nothing to leane up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but God, but a promiſe, nay, and God ſeems to frown too; if he look above him, there is a ſtormy sky, within him, there is a ſtormy conſcience, without him there a ſtormy world.</p>
            <p>And yet in all this, faith can venture it ſelfe upon God, runne into his boſome, when he ſeemes to be arm'd againſt him, hange the weight of its ſoule upon God, upon a promiſe, when nothing to ſenſe appeares, here is faith indeed; faith in its glory under a cloud; faith in its ſtrength, under this appearing weakneſſe: here is faith tryed to the back.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> grace here tryed, is our love.

            <p>There is no tryall of love, while we have ſuch diſpenſations from God as are fewell and attractives of love.</p>
            <p>While God ſmiles on us, our eſtate is proſperous, all things ſpeake love and good-will from God; theſe are attractives to beget, and fewell to increaſe love. But now when God ſhall bring a man into the deepe, exerciſe him with difficulties, ſeeme to overwhelme him with all his waves, as <hi>Iob</hi> complaines; and yet for all this the ſoule can cleave to him, love a frovvning God as vvell as a ſmiling God; a correcting, as vvell as a comforting God, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though thou kill me, yet will I truſt in thee.</hi> Or as the Church, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 44.9 to the 19.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The 3 grace he tryeth is our patience.</p>
            <p>Patience is ſuch a grace as is not tryed but by difficulties: where there is nothing to provoke or occaſion impatience, there is no tryall of patience. While <hi>Jonah</hi> had the Goard hee was calme enough: but when the Goard was gone, hee grew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64789:49"/>as hot as the Sun which ſhone upon him.</p>
            <p>It was the Devills argument concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1.</note> and it was true in the maine. God ſaid that <hi>Job</hi> was a holy man, a patient man: Why but ſaith Sathan, What thanks to him for that? he muſt needs be patient, who hath nothing to diſturbe his patience.</p>
            <p>As he is the patienteſt, ſo he is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man of all the children of the Eaſt; haſt not thou laden him with bleſſings, given him what his heart can wiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Children, riches, poſſeſſions, &amp;c. Nay, and haſt not thou made a hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him too, and fenced in all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by thy providence, ſo that nothing can break in, to annoy and diſturbe him in his happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Alas what tryall of patience is here, where there is nothing to diſturbe, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy him?</p>
            <p>Do but let me deale with him a little, and I will quickly ſound him, give mee but commiſſion to take away his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his goods, and to ſmite his body, and then wee ſhall quickly ſee his patience. This man who now ſeems ſo patient, will curſe thee to thy face.</p>
            <p>The mayne of his argument was this,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64789:49"/>and it was true in the mayne: That while all things which are fuell to patience are injoyned, while a man is in ptoſperitie, and hath what his heart can wiſh, here is no tryall of patience. But when a man is brought into the deep, plucked from the ſhore of his injoyments. When a man is brought into ſtraits and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here will bee the tryall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God often carry his people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep as he did him, and raiſe ſtorms &amp; troubles there, that he might diſcover his peoples patience. And when a man can now lye downe in the duſt, kiſſe the rod, juſtifie God, cleare him in all his dealings, and ſweetly accept of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his iniquity, when a man can by the power of Faith lay all the inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in his ſoul, ſilence all murmurings,
<note place="margin">26. Lev. 41.3. Lum. 32.</note> and give God the glory of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with him. Here is patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, patience in ſtrength. That is the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> God doth bring us into the the deep, as to diſcover, ſo to exerciſe our graces. The deep is the fitteſt place for exerciſe: the exerciſe of our faith, love, hope, patience, the grace of prayer, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Men will never caſt themſelves upon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64789:50"/>God, ſo long as they have any bottome to ſtand upon here below.</p>
            <p>Therefore he brings us into the deep, that when we have no other bottome, he might be our onely bottome.</p>
            <p>The exerciſe of faith is called a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill,
<note place="margin">14 Exod. 13.2 Jer. l. 30 Ifai. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to beheld the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> But a man will never ſtand ſtill, ſo long as he hath any friend to gadde unto. You ſee that in the Jews, 2 <hi>Jer. ult. Iſai.</hi> 30.1. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And therefore God doth bring us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep, into ſuch difficulties, wherein we can neither goe to others for ſuccour, nor others come to us, that now in this time our ſouls might find the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alone. So the exerciſe of faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a reſting upon God: but we will not reſt fully on him, ſo long as we have any thing elſe to reſt upon here below.</p>
            <p>And therefore God doth break in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Reeds on which we reſt, or makes them helpleſſe, and comfortleſſe to us, that we might depend alone on him.</p>
            <p>Againe, the exerciſe of faith is called a retiring our ſelves to him, a ſheltering of our ſelves in God, flying under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, running to him as our Tower. But this we ſhall never do, ſo long as we have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64789:50"/>any Bulwarks of our owne: The tower is the laſt refuge: and therefore God doth beat us out of our own Bulwarks, out of our owne meanes of proviſion, that wee might alone flye to him for ſecurity: So the excerciſe of faith is called an Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our ſelves on God: But ſo long as we finde a bortome here below, wee will never caſt Anchor upwards.</p>
            <p>And therefore God doth bring us into the deep, the mid'ſt of the Sea, where the ſoule can find no bottome to anchor on, that ſo the ſoule might caſt anchor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and reſt alone on God, who never fayled them that truſt in him. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 9.10.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.12</note> We know not what to doe; here was no bottome for him to anchor on below, a great enemy, and ſmall ſtrength to withſtand, and therefore hee anchors upwards: But our eyes are upon thee—.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the middeſt of the Sea, it is the fitteſt place for God to trye and exerciſe his people, and for God to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and help his people, wee ſhall bee moſt thankful, God wil get himſelf moſt glory, and the deliverance of his people will be moſt conſpicuous. If God ſhould
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64789:51"/>help us on the ſhore, while we are among our other ſuccours and helps, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would either obſcure, or take away the glory which belongs to God in a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>But when God doth pluck us from the ſhore, bring us into the deep, above the reach of creatures to relieve us, then if God help us, he doth inherite his owne glory: we will then ſay the finger of the Lord is here.</p>
            <p>None but a God could have diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted ſuch plots, none but a God could have layd ſuch ſtormes, none but hee could have wrought ſuch deliverance for us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Uſe</hi> Thinke it not much to goe downe into the deep; It is a place God chuſeth for the demonſtration of thy graces, and declaration of his own mercy.</p>
            <p>Wee had never knowne <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and love, <hi>Davids</hi> piety, <hi>Jobs</hi> pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Pauls</hi> courage and conſtancy, if they had been ever upon the ſhore, if God had not ſometime brought them into the the deep.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould we know either our ſinnes or our graces, if God did not ſometimes bring us upon exerciſes.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64789:51"/>
            <p>Haſt thou been in the midſt of the Sea? haſt thou been in the deep. 1. The depth of temptarions. 2. Of deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. Of outward trouble? And haſt thou cleaved noto God? haſt thou juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him? haſt thou loved him? haſt thou had experience of thy graces? have they abidden tryall? Here is ſomething to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the truth of thy graces to thee. Difficulties are exerciſes, and abiding difficulties are experiences to us of the truth of our graces. Thats ſurely ours which hath abiden temptation. There is no judging while you are on the ſhore, the tryal is when you come into the deep, one experience fetched out of the deep, will tend more to thy eſtabliſhment, than many promiſing evidences never put to the tryall: The deep demonſtrates, the truth of thy graces.</p>
            <p>And it declares the riches of Gods mercy. God takes delight to put forth himſelfe in deſperate caſes. In ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his mercy will be moſt viſible, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt thankfull, and deliverance moſt welcome.</p>
            <p>We ſhould never have the experince what God can doe, if we did not ſee what man cannot doe: you ſhould never know
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64789:52"/>the mercy of God, if you had not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of neceſſities above man.</p>

               <hi>Doctr.</hi> That there is not ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in the greateſt trouble and affliction,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64789:53"/>as there is good in the leaſt tryall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our graces.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples underwent a great deale of trouble upon the ſea: but had all this been a greater evill, then the exerciſe of their graces a good, Chriſt would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have fuffered the one for the other.</p>
            <p>We wonder ſometime that God ſhould bring his people, ſuch as hee loves, into ſtraits and difficulties: But you ſee God may do it for the exerciſe of your graces, the leaſt exerciſe of which will weigh downe all your trouble, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p>If God did not exerciſe our graces, we ſhould ſuffer them to ruſt; and grace is then moſt lovely, when it is moſt in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exerciſe; God ſuffers us often to be toſſed, becauſe wee doe not toſſe our ſelves; he ſuffers others to ranſack and rifle us, becauſe wee doe not rifle our own hearts; he ſuffers Sathan to winnow us, becauſe we neglect to ſift our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore doth God exerciſe us with variety of difficulties, that we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our ſelves. Againe it ſayes thus much to us:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> God doth ſometimes put his people to a leſſer trouble for their grearer good.</p>

            <p>The Phiſitian makes his Patient a little ſick for his greater healh: The Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon puts us to a little paine for a greater eaſe.

You are chaſtiſed of the Lord, that you might not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the world.</p>
            <p>That you might not love the world, he ſuffers the world to hate you: that you might be crucified to the world, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers you to bee crucified in the world: therefore doe you meet with many affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the world that you might not be condemned with the world. As there is a curſe hid in the beſt things to wicked men, a curſe in their health, their gold, ſilver, &amp;c. ſo there is a bleſſing hid in the worſt things to Gods people; a bleſſing in poverty, ſickneſſe, death it ſelfe.
<note place="margin">25 Pſalme 16 32 Jer. 40.</note> Hee hath ſaid, <hi>All his wayes are wayes of mercy;</hi> and hee will never depart from us from doing us good.</p>
            <p>As God makes one evill the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another to wicked men, ſo hee makes one evill the cure of another to his owne people. The Phyſitian orders poyſons to uſefull purpoſes: So God thoſe things which are evil in themſelves,

            <p>The Leproſie on <hi>Naamans</hi> body, was was an occaſion of the cure of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous ſoule: if his body had not beene Leprous, his ſoule had not been waſhed.

If I had not loſt ſo much of the Creature, I had not got ſo much of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> And this ſhould teach us a leſſon of patience under all Gods exerciſes, it is but the putting of thee to a little paine for thy greater eaſe; a little trouble for thy greater comfort; a little ſorrow for thy greater joy. All Gods ſad paſſages of providence to you

               <q>[The wind was contrary.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the next cauſe of their troubles; <hi>The wind was contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Contrariety is the ground of all ſtorms. Contrary ſpirits will ever cauſe tempeſt.</p>
            <p>That which raiſeth ſtormes betweene God and man, between man and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, between one creature and another, it is contrariety. Take away contrariety and take away ſtormes. The way to have a calme ſea is to ceaſe the winds: ſo the way to have calmneſſe in the Church, in the ſtate, is to take away contrariety. The Deciſions of the hand, are but the fruits of the differences in the heart. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64789:57"/>of mens judgements, doe ever raiſe differences and troubles without.</p>
            <p>If men were all of one mind, they might be all of one heart, and all would row the ſame way: but this is a happineſſe not to be expected, though prayed for, till the fourth watch when Chriſt ſhall enter the ſhip; but yet allowance for differences, may prevent ſtormes. A faire Latitude for differences may procure love, prevent troubles, where the contrary indangers te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, &amp;c. But why ſhould this cauſe ſtormes? me thinks if wicked men will not goe to heaven themſelves, yet they ſhould let them alone that would go. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ſay they would goe to heaven too, but they would not goe your pace: they will not overgoe the world, their pleaſures, profits, this is too faſt: what needs ſuch haſte: and therefore rather than mend their owne pace, they would take them away that goe before them.</p>
            <p>When they ſee others to walk in a more ſpirituall and holy way than themſelves, they are caſt and condemned in their own thoughts, that their way is not good, and having no deſire to come up to them, and to the rule, thereupon they hate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe that goe before them.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:64789:57"/>
            <p>And if I miſtake not this was the cauſe of the firſt Murther that ever was, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.12. <hi>Caine</hi> was of that wicked one who ſlew his Brother,
<note place="margin">1. John 3.</note> and wherefore ſlew hee him? Why ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Becauſe his owne Workes were evill, and his Brothers good.</hi> It was not becauſe God reſpected one, and not the other: for God tells him, 4. <hi>Geneſis</hi> 7. <hi>That if hee would doe well, he ſhould be accepted too: but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his owne workes were bad, and his Brothers good.</hi> But could this be a good reaſon? were his Workes bad? Why did hee not mend them? was this any cauſe to kill his Brother? This was the cauſe: His Workes were bad, and hee was convinced of that, both by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> proctiſe, and <hi>Gods</hi> different accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And becauſe hee had no mind to mend them, therefore he would kill <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> hee would murther him that vvent before him, that his Conſcience might not bee continually condemning and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of him, for that vvhich he had no mind to mend.</p>
            <p>And you have the like in the Scribes and Pharaſees, ſet out in the Parable of the Vineyard and Husbandman, they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64789:58"/>had Gods Vineyard, were the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Church, but they would yield no fruit:
<note place="margin">Luke 10.16, 11, 12.</note> God ſends to them over and over, they beat and miſ-uſed the Meſſengers. At laſt God ſends his Son, with this ſweet expectation; <hi>Sure they will reverence my Sonne,</hi> though they have perſecuted and killed the Prophets,
<note place="margin">13. verſe.</note> yet my ſonne ſhall find other acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; ſure they will receive my Sonne.
<note place="margin">14 verſe.</note> But marke now their Spirits, <hi>This is the Sonne, ſay they, come let us kill him, that the Inheritance may be ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know it is a Parable, the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard is the Church, the ordinances and the fruit which God expected, was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and ſutable obedient walking: The meſſengers that God ſent to call to them for it; were the Prophets, who called them to obedience and holineſſe. But becauſe they deſturbed them in their way, and would not ſuffer them to live as they liſt, therefore they miſuſed them, perſecuted, killed them: Laſt of all, God ſends his ſonne, and then they ſay, <hi>This is the heire, let us kill him, and the Inheritance is ours:</hi> Then the day was theirs, they might ſinne without check,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64789:58"/>controule, they ſhould bee diſturbed no more, they ſhould doe their will and none ſhould check them, here was the reaſoning of their heart.</p>
            <p>To theſe heights in ſinning doth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart carry men at laſt.</p>
            <p>Sinne will never reſt, till it hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a man all into ſin, deviliſhed men; you ſee how many there are that ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, not onely a forme of godlineſſe, but their moralities, nay even their naturall Conſciences; ſinne will ſpend at laſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the main ſtocke, and eate out the very naturall principles of men.</p>
            <p>There is yet another thing which offers it ſelfe to us from this.</p>

            <p>The cloud may hinder the light of the Sun from our eyes, but it cannot take the Sun from the sky, it is there though it do not appeare. Chriſt may ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gone, when yet he is really there; and it muſt be your wiſdome to live by faith, when you cannot live by ſence, to ſee him with you by his grace, when you cannot behold him in his comforts.</p>
            <p>But we will paſſe this.— There is one thing more that I would preſent to you from the whole tryall, which you ſee is heightned by ſeverall gradations; they were in the midſt of the ſea, and in the darke of the night, nay and toſſed with waves, the winde was contrary, &amp; Chriſt himſelfe was abſent: here is wave upon wave, trouble upon trouble.

            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:64789:67"/>
            <p>You reade an excellent paſſage to this purpoſe in the <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.4, &amp;c. <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſiſters ſent to Chriſt, to tell him, that their brother was ſicke, and intreat him to come downe and heale him: Chriſt anſwers, <hi>This ſickneſſe is not unto death, but that the glory of God might be revealed, and manifested.</hi> And mark now the way that Chriſt takes to advance his glory, Verſe 6. <hi>When hee had heard,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>that he was ſick, he abode two dayes still in the ſame place where he was.</hi> One would thinke this a ſtrange paſſage; hee ſhould rather have gone preſently, and have recovered him. But this was now the way Chriſt took to advance his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he doth not only ſuffer him to be ſick, but to dye of his ſickneſſe, nay, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and to lye in the grave foure dayes: and thus lets the difficulty go beyond the power of man, that the power and glory of God might be more viſible and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: as he tels us in the 15. and 40.

            <p>You have the like alſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 8. from the 41. to the 49. Verſe.</p>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> God doth heighten our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties before deliverance, that hee might heighten our prayſes, our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for a deliverance.</p>
            <p>God is very deſirous of the prayſes of his Saints: as he doth bathe himſelfe in their teares, ſo he doth delight himſelfe in their joyes: hee loves to heare their praiſes as well as their prayers.</p>
            <p>And therefore doth God bring us into ſtraits, and heighten our ſtraights, that being delivered, we might be more inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with thankfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> difficulty at the Red Sea, did furniſh him with matter of prayſes, when hee was come to the ſhore, 15 <hi>Exodus Who is a God like to thee? glorious in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, fearefull in prayſes, doing wonders,</hi> 11 <hi>verſe.</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64789:68"/>that wee might be more thankfull in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances.</p>
            <p>Theſe with many other might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named. To conclude this: Let us not bee caſt downe, nor diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

               <hi>Doct.</hi> That when Chriſt ſees the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his people upon the ſhore, he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64789:69"/>will not long be off the Sea: when hee once takes a view of his peoples troubles, he ſtayes not long, but goes forth to help them.</p>
            <p>You ſee this in the 3. Exod. 7, 8. <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my people in Egypt, by reaſon of their Taske-Maſters, for I know their ſorrowes.</hi> And thereupon it followes: <hi>And I am come downe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of the hand of the Egiptians.</hi> When God once ſees, he preſently helps. As he is ſaid to come downe to ſee ſinne, before he puniſh it; as of <hi>Sodome:</hi> and when he comes downe to ſee, hee doth aſſuredly come out to puniſh. So he is ſaid to come downe, to ſee the troubles of his people, before he doe deliver them; and if once he come to ſee, he wil aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to helpe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> Let us then beſpeak God to looke downe upon our afflictions: ſay with the Church. <hi>Look down, O Lord, from heaven,</hi>

               <hi>and viſite thy vine; it is burnt with fire, it is cut downe,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>God hath bowells of mercy, if once he look downe he will viſit: our eye affects our heart, and moves our hand. Gods heart moves his eye, and when his eye is once moved to ſee, his hand and heart

               <hi>Doct.</hi> There cannot be want of means, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> have a purpoſe to relieve his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>It was not a ſtormy Sea that ſhould bee able to ſeperate between Chriſt and his Diſciples in trouble: though there was a Sea, and a ſtormy tempeſtuous Sea betweene Chriſt and them, yet this ſhall not part him and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

            <p>Nothing ſhall hinder Chriſt from going to his people in trouble; no Sea, no ſickneſſe, no priſon, nor any thing ſhall ſeparate between him and us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> This might be a mighty conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionu to the people of God, you can never be in ſuch a condition, as that Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to you.</p>
            <p>If our reliefes lay in men, many things might interrupt and hinder our ſuccour. In many afflictions, or friends can but ſtand on the ſhore, ſee us, and pitty us at the moſt, but they cannot come to us, they cannot helpe us.</p>

            <p>Many things parts us and friends here. It is ſaid, afflictions parts friends: they part the affections of friends, where there are any who with <hi>Ruth</hi> will hold cloſe to a Sun burnd <hi>Naomi:</hi> many with <hi>Orpah</hi> will fall off. Nay and many things parts the aſſiſtance of friends, though not the affections of friends, 5. Jud. 15. <hi>For the deviſions of</hi> Ruben <hi>there were great thoughts of heart:</hi> There was a Jordan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Ruben</hi> and their brethren, that though they had the affections of breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,

            <p>But now nothing can part Chriſt and the ſoule in trouble.</p>

            <p>It is not ſaid that hee went towards them, but hee went to them: men may onely goe towards us in trouble, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe to us; but Chriſt, if hee goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he goes to them. Chriſt reliefes are full and perfect. Againe it is ſaid he went to them, when yet he wes but going towards them: Indeed hee is as good as there already, as ſoone as hee ſets out to goe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> What Chriſt doth purpoſe to doe, it is as good as done already; though not in <hi>effectu operis,</hi> in regard of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it be yet to doe, yet <hi>reſpectu decreti,</hi> in reſpect of his purpoſe it is as good as done already.</p>
            <p>Hence you read in the 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 30. <hi>Whom he hath juſtified he hath glorified.</hi> Though glorification be to come in reſpect of the full poſſeſſion of it; yet it is as ſure as come already in reſpect of the ſtability of the decree.</p>

               <hi>yee are bleſſed, for great is your reward in the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> which inference could not be ſound; if that future <hi>medium</hi> were not certaine, in reſpect of the firmneſſe of the decree, to faith, which gives to the promiſes of God a kind of preſubſiſting, and preſent being, though future in accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> And this is a comfort to us, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God purpoſeth to doe for us, or to doe againſt our enemies its as ſure as done already.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What ever God hath purpoſed to doe for us, it is as ſure as done: bleſſed are they who are perſecuted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake, <hi>for great is their reward in the Kingdsme of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath made many glorious promiſes to his Church: and though in reſpect of execution of them, they are yet to come, yet in reſpect of the ſtability of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they are as good as performed. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> when he had a promiſe, ſets the ſingers to praiſe the Lord in the beauty
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64789:73"/>of holineſſe, hee was as ſure of it, as if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done: It was his worke rather to believe than fight, and to ſhout a victory rather than to ſtrike a ſtroke, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.21.22. <hi>He appoynted Singers to prayſe the Lord in the beauty of his holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What ever God hath purpoſed againſt the enemies of the Church it is as good as done already.</p>
            <p>He hath ſaid that Anti-Chriſt ſhall down: and though all the world ſhould contribute their power, and put to their ſhoulders to hold him up, yet they ſhall never be able.</p>
            <p>Nay, God hath ſaid, ſhe is fallen alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. <hi>Babilon is fallen, is fallen:</hi> The word is doubled, to ſhew the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of her ruine. Let all the world cry it up, if God cry it downe, it ſhal fall. The Peece hath ſtruck dead, before the noyſe be heard: So Anti-Chriſt is dead ſtruck in the threatning, although the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his fall be not yet come unto us.</p>
            <p>Againe it is ſaid that <hi>[Chriſt went to them:]</hi> hee doth not ſay delivered them, rebuked the ſtorme, but Chriſt went to them.</p>
            <p>It is a happy thing when Chriſt doth not only helpe us, but come to us, Chriſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64789:74"/>helps many whom yet he comes not to: God out of his royall bounty doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things for thoſe, whom yet he will not owne.</p>
            <p>Chriſt gives bread to many, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines many a family, that yet he will not live in: many that partake of his mercy, that doe not partake of himſelfe: many that he gives other things to, but he doth not give himſelfe.
<note n="l" place="margin">Mea non proſuns ſine me nec tua pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt ſine te.

Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be in trouble than to bee delivered, and Chriſt not come to thee: better to have the preſence of Chriſt in trouble, than deliverance, and want Chriſt. That man hath ſmall comfort in a deliverance, who enjoyes not Chriſt with it. It is but a reprievall, not a diſchrrge. It is a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in judgement, rather than mercy.</p>
            <p>There are preſervaſions, that may bee called reſervations to worſer evills. Such are theſe.</p>

Chriſt ever in his loweſt abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhewed ſomething of his deity. When he ſuffered upon the Croſſe, which was his loweſt abaſement, then like the Sun he lets out the greateſt luſtre and brighteſt beames of the deity, when ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, even then he rent the rocks, opened the gravs, ſealed up the beams of the Sun, &amp;c.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64789:75"/>ſhould flye from the wrath of man.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is obſerveable, that Chriſt doth here doe foure great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to ſtabliſh their hearts againſt ſuch a temptation.</p>

            <p>By theſe declaring, that though hee went from <hi>Herod,</hi> yet it was not for fear, not that hee thought hee was not able to preſerve himſelfe and Diſciples; he that could doe all this, might have done the other.</p>
            <p>It is Gods great mercy that hee hath been pleaſed in his loweſt abaſements to give us withall ſome demonſtrances of his deity.</p>
            <p>When he hungred, he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a man, but when he fed thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands with a few loaves, he demonſtrated himſelfe to be God.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64789:75"/>himſelfe to be man, but when he walked on the ſea, hee declared himſelfe to be God.</p>
            <p>In his life he ſeemed to be man and not God, he was ſubject to our infirmities: but in his miracles, raiſing the dead, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eyes to the blinde, healing the ſick, caſting out Devils, he declared himſelfe to be God as well as man.</p>
            <p>When he hung upon the croſſe he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee man, but when hee rent the vaile of the Temple, darkned the Sunne, ſhook the Earth, rent the Rocks, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Thiefe, he declared himſelfe God as well as man, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Why, but Chriſt could as well have helped them on the ſhoare, as to have come and walked to them on the ſea. But then they had nor ſo cleerely knowne Chriſt helped them: either they might have attributed their ſafety to their own endeavours in rowing, or they might have thought the ſtorme ceaſed by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp;c. And therefore Chriſt comes to them before he helps them, that they might ſee and acknowledge it was his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> It is the beſt part of a deliverance to ſee and acknowledge the deliverer.</p>

            <p>It was a ſtrange way that Chriſt went in the deliverance of his Diſciples, to walk on the ſea, never was this heard of before, God hath delivered his people by deviding the ſea, but never before by walking on the ſea.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> That God will goe unheard of untracted wayes, ſtrange wayes to deliver his people, rather then his people ſhall not be delivered.</p>
            <p>God is not tyed to any way, his paths are in the great waters, and his footſteps are not knowne. God wals in the wayes of the deliverance of his Churches, as a man that walks in the ſnow, who becauſe he would not be tracted; he often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his ſhooe.</p>
            <p>Whole Volumes might be writ of the many ſtrange wayes that God hath gone in the deliverance of his Church &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Sometimes he hath done it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by himſelfe: as you ſee in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12.23, 24. <hi>Iulian,</hi> who when he went to warre againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he vowed to his Idoll Gods, that he would give them a ſacrifice of all the Chriſtians in the Empire when he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back: but he was prevented by death, being ſmitten with an unknowne blow from Heaven. So God delivered the Church in <hi>Maximinus</hi> his time:</p>
            <p>ſometime he hath done it mediately:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either by making themſelves as inſtruments to deſtroy themſelves; as you ſee in the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Midianites, Iudg.</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:64789:77"/>7.22. And thus was <hi>Paul</hi> delivered, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or by arming ſecond cauſes, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtrength into weak and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtruments, for the deliverance of his Church. As <hi>Ieremy</hi> was drawne out of the dungeon with old rotten rags, thrown aſide and good for nothing, <hi>Ier.</hi> 38.11. So the Lord doth deliver his Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſuch inſtruments as the enemies thereof would before have looked upon with ſcorne, as deſpiſed and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtruments. You ſee this in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in <hi>Deborah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Sometimes arming naturall cauſes, the Sun, the Moone, the Stars, Haile, Winde: the Starres in their courſe are ſaid to fight againſt <hi>Siſera:</hi> the Lord ſlew Iſraels enemies with haile, the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> with the Sun ſhining on the water. And we read in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, that the Chriſtians being to fight againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> &amp; being in great diſtreſſe for water, upon their prayers, God ſent abundance of raine, but incounter'd their enemies with thunder and fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in remembrance of which, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> called the Chriſtian Legion
<note n="p" place="margin">

                  </gap> legio ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatrix.</note> the thundring Legion. Theſe we may take
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64789:77"/>for a taſte of thoſe innumerable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that might be alledged, of the ſtrange wayes GOD hath gone to deliver his Church. He walkes ſtill upon the ſea, goes untracted wayes in deliverance of his Church: how ordinary is it with him, to make thoſe things which in themſelves are diſtructive, to be helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the deliverance of his Church and people. He that can finde a paſſage on the ſeas,
<note n="q" place="margin">Mille mali ſpecies, mille ſaiutis erant.</note> wants no wayes to deliver and helpe his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> And therefore let us never diſtruſt in our God, whoſe arme cannot be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he cannot ſave, who can never be brought to a non plus, never poſed in the wayes of deliverance. He is not only able to raiſe deliverance out of the duſt, but out of nothing he can create delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; nay, he can not only out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but out of contraries, he can make contraries ſerve his ends. Even his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſerviceable to the purpoſes of his mercy and deliverance.</p>
            <p>When God hath a purpoſe to deliver his Church, he can make thoſe things which are in themſelves diſtructive, to be ſubſerviently furthering the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his people; he can walk on the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64789:78"/>ſea, he can make a way to his people in trouble, and in that a furtherance to a deliverance, which was in its ſelfe the greateſt hindrance. As the Phyſitian can order poyſonous and diſtructive ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to phyſicall and healthfull purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſo can God make thoſe things for us which are uſed as engines againſt us, and make our enemies doe his work with their own hands.</p>
            <p>God hath wayes enough, he cannot be brought to the utmoſt of his thoughts; and therefore when you are at an end in your thoughts: Learn to ſhut your eyes to things below, and turne your eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to him that is above. Say with <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat. We know not what to do, but our eyes they are upon thee, who hath ever an eye to them, whoſe eyes are fixed upon him, and will in his owne due time work deliverance for them.</hi> And that is the next thing.</p>

            <p>And they were called watches, becauſe they uſed once in three houres to change their ſeverall watches, and put in new men to watch.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> God doth not only exerciſe his people with troubles, but he doth length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and continue their troubles alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doe deliver them.</p>
            <p>And therefore this doth preach pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Chriſtian fortitude to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe preſſures and calamities, and to wait with patience Gods time of deliverance, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.26. It is good for a man to hope and quietly to wait for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God. But this will fall in the other queſtions.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Why Chriſt came no ſooner to helpe them.</p>
            <p>It was for divers reaſons, for the tryall and for the exerciſe of their graces, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the advancement of his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in deliverance. It was the time which he choſe for their deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> God hath a fulneſſe of time to accompliſh all his purpoſes, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all his promiſes to his people. God hath a fourth watch.</p>
            <p>Gods mercy moveth him to come in bond, and his wiſdome pitcheth upon the day of payment. God promiſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:64789:79"/>a childe, but there was a time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the performance of it. He promiſed to deliver Iſrael out of Egypt, and to bring them into Canaan, but he had an appointed time for the doing of it: hee promiſed to ſet <hi>David</hi> on the throne, to bring his people out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> to ſend Chriſt into the world, but he took a fulneſſe of time to accompliſh all this in.</p>
            <p>God hath a fulneſſe of time to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all his thoughts of mercy to his people: and therefore doth he take time to quicken us to ſeeke, to prepare us for the mercy, to ripen our enemies for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> And therefore this ſpeaks patient waiting upon God. God hath had ever ſome great promiſes on foot, upon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to exerciſe the graces of his people, their faith, patience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The great promiſes which God kept on foot in the Old Teſtament, was the promiſe of Chriſt, which was promiſed in <hi>Adams</hi> time, renewed in <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and every age after; and this he kept on foot to exerciſe their graces, their faith, their hope, expectation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25.26.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:64789:80"/>
            <p>And the great promiſe he keepes on foot now, is the down-fall of Antichriſt; and this to exerciſe our graces too; our faith to beleeve it, our hope to expect, and patience to wait for it. How many Worthies of whom we may ſay, as of them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. that have dyed in faith, <hi>Saw the promiſe afarre off</hi>

            <p n="1">1 Wait upon God in deferres, though it tarry, wait for it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. Though God do ſeeme to deferre

            <p n="2">2 Wait upon God in ſeeming deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; when all things ſeem to walke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the performance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet hold up your hearts to beleeve and wait the performance of it.</p>
            <p>But 3 eſpecially hang upon God when he ſeemes to come in and ſpeake the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of promiſes: ſlackneſſe in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth ill befit either the incomes or expectations of mercy.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:64789:80"/>
            <p>But ſo wayt as to doe your duty. There are ſome promiſes which God doth bring about by his owne immediate hand. Some which hee will accompliſh by meanes. In the former, our wayting doth extend no further than to ſupplication, and expectation, as you ſee the promiſe of Chriſt, to the performance of which, we could do nothing, it was to be wrought by God onely; and there all our worke was to pray and wait, as they did, 2 <hi>Luke</hi> 25.36. Where you ſhall read of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and others who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Temple night and day pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and wayting for the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that was all they could doe, pray and wait. But now in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch promiſes as God will effect by meanes, here we muſt not onely pray, and wayt, but uſe our utmoſt indeavours to bring about the thing promiſed.</p>
            <p>The great promiſe which God hath made to us of the downfall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, it is a promiſe that ſhall be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by meanes, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. and the 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. It is ſaid, <hi>The Kings of the earth ſhal joyne together, and hate the whore, and make her deſolate, and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire, &amp;c.</hi> Here meanes is to be uſed.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:64789:81"/>
            <p>And if but three things were done throughly, it would greatly ſpeed his ruine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Cleare preaching, Secondly, Spirituall walking, Thirdly, joynt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Cleare preaching: He was borne in the darke, in the darkeſt times. and he lives in the darke, the darkeſt places. He is a Brat begotten between the devill and ignorance, the devill the father, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance the mother, and Idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition his eldeſt daughters. Now clear preaching would diſcover this man of ſin, the light of truth would diſcover the darkneſſe of errour. This is one way ſet downe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>The Lord ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth, and destroy him by the brightneſſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Spirituall and holy walking. All his religion lies in fleſhy and carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, hee is ſaid ro bee the beaſt that comes out of the earth, 13. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. Indeed the Romiſh Religion is out of the earth, it is an earthy worſhip, hath earthly grounds, earthly aymes, earthly ends. All the conſiderations that feed Popery are out of the earth, from ſuch
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64789:81"/>things as pleaſe the ſences, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now if we were more ſpirituall in our worſhip, more holy in our lives, wee ſhould blaſt al his painted pomp, it could not ſtand up under it: for it is not the ſtrength of his cauſe, but the coldneſſe and luke-warmneſſe of our hearts which holds him up.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Joynt praying. When God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his people from <hi>Babilon,</hi> hee ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up their hearts mightily to ſeek him. So when he delivers his people from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall <hi>Bahilon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non tam ferro quam fide &amp; votis. Aug.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I never read that ever God beſtowed any extraordinary mercy and deliverance upon his people, but before he beſtowed it, he mightily ſtirred up the hearts of his People to ſeek him. And I never read that ever God did mightily ſtirre up the hearts of his people to ſeek him, but ſome great mercy and deliverance was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: prayer uſeth to bee the harbinger of mercy. He doth not ſay to the ſeed of <hi>Iacob, ſeek my face in vaine.</hi> When trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſends us to prayer, deliverance ſhall ſend us to prayſes:
<note place="margin">45. Iſ. 29.</note> God will make his people as thankful, as prayerful, as thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64789:82"/>enjoyers, as earneſt ſeekers.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the ſecond, why Chriſt came no ſooner: wee come now to the third, why he ſtayes no longer.</p>
            <p>And that may bee becauſe he would not overthrow the graces of his people; God loves to everciſe grace,
<note n="b" place="margin">Deus per adverſitates ſuos tentat, ſed non dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquit. Cart.</note> but hee will not deſtroy grace.</p>
            <p>The Muſitian hee will wind up his ſtrings to the height, it makes then the ſweeteſt muſick, but hee will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind them, leſt he break them: So God loves to exerciſe the graces of his people, to wind them up to the height,

            <p>And this doth ariſe from a ſecret root of pride and unbeliefe: either pride, that we will not ſubmit to Gods wiſedome, Gods will, Gods time, Gods meanes, but will propound God away, and limit God to time and means: or elſe it ariſeth from unbelief: as you ſee it plain in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> his failing in wayting for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the promiſe, did ariſe from a ſecret diſtruſt of the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, firſt he ſayd, <hi>All men are lyars,</hi> and then he ſayes, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul.</p>
            <p>And yet it may ariſe from ignorance too: we are unacquainted with the wayes that God takes for the performance of his Promiſes. God may walke with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, when to ſence he ſeems to walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: as you ſee in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> God ſeemed in all to walke againſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but if you doe examine the ſtory, you ſhal find in ail this, God walked with his Promiſe, and <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Priſon was the way for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> advancement, the like of <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> And the Promiſe is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neareſt to fulfilling, when to ſence and reaſon it ſeemes furtheſt off. Looke but on she ſtory of Scripture, and you ſhall ſee this truth, that when man hath
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64789:83"/>had leaſt hopes, and probabilities that the Promiſe ſhould bee fulfilled, than hath been the time which God hath taken to accompliſh his Promiſe.</p>
            <p>You ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was never more improbobility that the Promiſe ſhould bee fulfilled, than at that time when it was fulfilled, 4. <hi>Romans</hi> 18, 19. <hi>Sarah's</hi> wombe was dead, and <hi>Ahraham</hi> was old, his body dead too: they had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived the ſtrength and hopes of nature, if he had but looked upon himſelf who was now dead, and upon <hi>Sarah,</hi> whoſe womb was dead alſo, every thought would have given a lye to the Promiſe, he could not but ſee an utter impoſſibility in the courſe of nature, that ever this Promiſe ſhould be effected, if hee had conſulted with fleſh and bloud. And yet you ſee that then when the Promiſe ſeemed moſt unlikely to bee fulfilled, was the time God chuſe for the fulfilling of it. The like of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Iſrael, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will give you one inſtance more, 14. <hi>Zac.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>At evening time it ſhall be light:</hi> they expected it in the day, that was the moſt likely, the evening was moſt improbable, then is nothing but darknes to be expected, but at evening it ſhall be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64789:84"/>light, the moſt improbable time.</p>
            <p>But the maine thing that this ſpeakes to us is this: you ſee here the Diſciples had beene in great danger, and they had beene long conflicting with theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp; were now ready to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the mercy of the Sea, much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it was not poſſible for them to hold out. As <hi>Job</hi> ſayes, 6. <hi>Iob</hi> 12. <hi>Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones, or is my fleſh of Braſſe.</hi> Certainly they could not much longer endure, they were now ready to give up.

            <p n="1">1 Why God ſuffers us to be brought into extremities before he help us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Why God doth help us in extremities.</p>
            <p>I will be briefe on them, being things frequently preſſed, you are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them in your own thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God ſuffers us to be brought into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities before he help us, that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might be more conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt had helped the Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64789:85"/>they had uſed all meanes to helpe themſelves, they might perhaps have thought that their owne induſtry would have helped; they could by their owne wiſdome &amp; ſtrength have relieved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And therefore Chriſt ſtaies
<note n="q" place="margin">Deus quos in aeternum diligit, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando ad tempus relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit. Greg. in cap. 30. Job.</note> till they were brought to extremities, lets them go to the utmoſt of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that the helpe of God might be more viſible to them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3, 4. Chriſts hour of helpe, is, when our glaſſe is out.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God ſuffers it, as to make his mercy conſpicuous, ſo to make his mercy great in their eyes. The great deſigne that God doth drive, is the advancement of his own glory; and therefore hee ſuffers us to be brought into troubles, and to extremities in thoſe troubles, that his glory, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his mercy, of his truth, wiſdome, might be advanced by men.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To quicken us to prayer, neceſſities do mightily ſtir up to duties, and makes the ſoul earneſt in it. You ſee the Church in <hi>Hesters</hi> time, &amp;c. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.50.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To inlarge his peoples hearts with
<note n="r" place="margin">Quia ex Dei beneficiis non ſatis ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcimus. il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius bonita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ideo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſalutis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa immittere adverſa ſoler.</note>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:64789:86"/>thankfulneſſe; things eaſily got, are as ſoone forgot, where a mercy in neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity will be ſet up as a living remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of praiſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe, with many others might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, why God doth ſuffer his people to be brought to extremities before he help.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Why God doth helpe us in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe God is ingaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us in ſtraits.</p>
            <p>There are foure mercifull ingagements of God, which moves him to relieve us in our ſtraits.</p>
            <p n="1">1 becauſe wee are his people he is our God, we are his Spouſe, he our husband; we are his children, he our father; we are his members, he our head: what will not a loving father do for his childe, &amp;c. We are his by choice, his by purchaſe, his by covenant; and there is nothing he doth in the world with more delight, then thoſe things he doth for his people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is nothing to ingage him to make us his people before he did make us his people, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>He loved us, becauſe he loved us,</hi> &amp;c. but there is ſomething to ingage him to doe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64789:86"/>for us now hee hath made us his people, becauſe we are his people. This is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet downe in the 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 12.21. <hi>The Lord will not caſt off his people for his great names ſake:</hi> and why? what is the ingagement? nothing but this; <hi>Seeing it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe he hath made many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes to us. Promiſes of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: take that in <hi>Iſay</hi> 33.16. A place ſpeaks fully, <hi>He ſhall dwell on high;</hi> out of the reach of all his enemies, nay higher many heights: but is it not poſſible to reach him? if you did, yet not hurt him, <hi>he is in a place of defence,</hi> but that is not ſo ſtrong but we may come to him? yea, his place of defence is the munition of Rocks: yea, but we ſhall ſtarve him out; there is no plowing and ſowing on rocks, <hi>but bread ſhall be given him.</hi> Yea, but what ſhall he doe for water? there is no getting of water out of the rock; but he ſhall have <hi>waters too:</hi> but though hee have they will faile: no, <hi>his waters ſhall be ſure, never failing waters.</hi> And look downe in the twenty one Verſe, there another; and <hi>Iſay</hi> 43.3, 4. <hi>I gave Egypt for thy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64789:87"/>ranſome, Ethiopia and Seba for thee:</hi> the Church of God was in bondage and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in Egypt, and he gave Egypt for her ranſome: how? That is, becauſe they could not be delivered without the loſſe of Egypt; God would rather part with the whole land of Egypt, then his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould not be ranſomed, he would ſinke the whole land of Egypt if it ſtood between his people and deliverance. So in the fourth Verſe, <hi>I will give men for thee, and people for thy life. I will not ſtick to give the lives of thouſands to uphold thine, multitudes ſhall be deſtroyed, rather then that thou ſhouldeſt not be preſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 A third ingagement is, becauſe his people truſt in him.</p>
            <p>Truſt is a kinde of ingagement upon a man although he had made never a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But what is it when it is upon a promiſe. No man will deceive another that truſts on him; we uſe to ſay, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile him, he truſts upon me: and do you think God will. Aſſure your ſelves there was never any who truſted upon God, who devolved his ſoule on him, but he found God to be that to him that he expected: faith ingageth all the power, wiſdome, mercy of God, to releeve you;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64789:87"/>and if all theſe can helpe, you ſhall not want ſuccour in your extremities.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A fourth ingagement, becauſe his people ſeek him. He doth not ſay to the ſeed of <hi>Iacob, Seek my face in vaine, Iſay</hi> 45.19. Faith and prayer will remove Mountaines: nothing ſhall be too hard for that people to doe; whoſe hearts and ſpirits he holds up to beleeve and pray. There is a kinde of omnipotency in faith and prayer, becauſe theſe two ſet the great God, yea, the greatneſſe of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the great God to work for us. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> uſed to pray, <hi>Let our will be done, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at voluntas noſtra.</hi> I have read of a ſtory of him, that having been in his ſtudy ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with God about the buſineſſe of the Church, and having received a gracious anſwer, he comes downe and cryes, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus, Vicimus,</hi> We have overcome, the day is ours: and ſo it fell out, ſaith the ſtory, the Church prevailed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. God doth helpe his people in extremities, that both we our ſelves, and the generations to come might be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to truſt in him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We our ſelves. We reade this, the fruit of Gods helping Iſrael in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the red ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. They ſaw
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64789:88"/>the great work God had done, and they beleeved God. <hi>David</hi> thus reaſons, <hi>The God who delivered me from the Lion and Beare, &amp;c. will. Pſal.</hi> 63.7. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt been my helper, therefore under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of thy wings I will roioyce. I have had experience of thy goodneſſe, therefore will I depend on thee:</hi> where experience is the promiſe, aſſurance may be the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>David</hi> was a man of many choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods goodneſſe, and he was choice of them, he laid them up, and made uſe of them at every need. It is a paſſage not to be neglected, when he was forced to flye from <hi>Saul;</hi> comming to <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Prieſt, he deſired him to lend him a weapon for his defence, hee told him he had none, ſave only the ſword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> whom he had ſlaine; <hi>There is none to that,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, give it mee.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 21.9. This was a Trophie of Gods former goodneſſe; it was both an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and a weapon; in carrying this, he tooke an experience with him, which might comfort him in ſtraits. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the generations to come might be incouraged to truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Thou haſt not forſaken
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64789:88"/>nor thou wilt not forſake them that truſt in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. God will helpe his people in extremity for the diſappointment and torture of wicked men.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Haman</hi> had prevailed ſo far as to get a bloody decree againſt the <hi>Church of God,</hi> no doubt hee joyed exceedingly, as one that promiſed to himſelfe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of them: and he brought it up very high: there was mans extremity. But you ſee how God croſſeth it; and who is able to expreſſe the vexation and torture of <hi>Haman</hi> for his diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He goes home, and vexeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he could not eat, nor drinke, nor ſleepe, for very vexation that his deſigne did not take. The like of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> he hangs himſelfe for very pride and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. God hath wayes enough to make wicked men to gnaſh their teeth before they come to hell: and this is one way to bring his people into ſtraits, and put the wicked in a kinde of hope of having their will on the godly: and then relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his people and diſappointing them, no man knowes what vexation and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this is to their ſpirits.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64789:89"/>
            <p>Theſe, with many other reaſons might be named, as becauſe now deliverance will be moſt welcome, his people moſt thankfull, helpe moſt glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> But to conclude this. Let us not be caſt downe and too much troubled, though God do bring us into extremities before he helpe us, you ſee it is Gods time of helpe. When the extremities of a people are above the reliefes of creatures, it is not only our time to ſeek, but it is Gods time to helpe us: You ſee it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.12. <hi>Give us helpe from trouble, for vaine is the helpe of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are five ſpeciall times when God will helpe his people.</p>
            <p n="1">1 When we know not what to doe; when we are brought to the utmoſt of our thoughts and know not what to doe: Such a ſtrait was Iſrael in at the red Sea; they knew not what to do; the ſea before them, the Egyptians behinde them. But this was the time of Gods help. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35. It is there ſaid concerning the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods people, <hi>Their feet ſhall ſlide in due time:</hi> but when is that? he ſhewes in the 36 Verſe, when he ſeeth that his peoples power is gone, &amp;c. when they know not what to do. Such a ſtrait was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64789:89"/>
               <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> in 2 Chronicl. 20.12. <hi>Wee have no might againſt this great multitude that comes againſt us, neither know we what to doe, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> This was Gods time of help.</p>
            <p>Gods time of help is uſually when mans time of help is gone. 31. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 36, 37. <hi>There is hope in thy end,</hi> when there was in a manner an end of all hope, when they had ſpent up all their ſtock of hopes, then doth God ſay, there is hope in thine end. You read in the 33. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7, 8, 9. verſes, of a ſtrange introduction to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and deliverance. <hi>Behold their valiant ones ſhall cry without, the Embaſſadours of peace ſhall weep bitterly, the high wayes lye waſte, and the wayfering man ceaſeth,— the earth mourneth and languiſheth, Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is aſhamed, and hewen downe, Sharon is like a wilderneſſe.</hi> — Here is a ſad Preface: what can be expected to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but as ſad a ſtory,
<note n="*" place="margin">Sic conſuevit dominus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementiones labores im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere, velu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti indices vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinae libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.

As you ſee the like 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.18.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:64789:90"/>
            <p n="2">2. When wee know not what God will doe, when God ſeems to forget his People, and in his outward Providences to walke contrary to his owne promiſes. When wee are brought to a ſtand, and know not what to think, then is there a time for God to ſtep forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> when hee was brought to that ſtand by preſent providences to him, that hee begins to queſtion, the truth of Gods promiſes: <hi>All men are lyars.</hi> He was now wound up to the height, it was time for God to come, leſt all break aſſunder.</p>
            <p>A third time when God will helpe: when we are brought to ſuch ſtraits, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee muſt either ſinne foully: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt ſuffer ſadly.</p>
            <p>In this ſtrait was <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children, either they muſt ſinne foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſuffer ſadly: if they bowed downe to the Image they ſinned foully; if not, they were to be caſt into the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and ſo were to ſuffer ſadly. And now was the time that God took to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the enimies are carryed on with moſt rage, and promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt ſucceſſe, againſt the Church

When men ſhew themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, then will God ſhew himſelf gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>But how ſhall we know that? he tels us in the fourteenth verſe, <hi>for thy ſervants take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favour the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64789:91"/>duſt thereof.</hi> That is, they mourn, <hi>(t)</hi> they pray,

            </p>
            <p>As when the Lord hath an intent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a People, he doth either expreſſely charge them not to pray for them, as hee did <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> 14. <hi>Ier.</hi> 11. Or hee doth ſecretly dead, and ſtrayten their hearts, that they cannot Pray. So when he doth ſtirre up the hearts of his People to ſeek him, it is an evident demonſtration that God will doe great things for a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Prayer is the Harbinger of mercy; When God purpoſes to give, he ſtirres up us to begge: and this begging puts us into a frame for receiving. You read in the third Chap. of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> 19. verſe, God had promiſed to doe great things for his People; but at laſt ſaith, <hi>How ſhall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleaſant land?</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I have purpoſes of mercy to thee, I have thoughts of deliverance, &amp;c. But what way ſhal I take to bring about this? How ſhall I doe with thee that I may bring about this purpoſe? Mark what
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64789:91"/>followes; <hi>and I ſaid thou ſhalt call me me Father:</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have now bethought me of a way, I will poure a ſpirit of Prayer upon thee, thou ſhalt call me Father, and ſo I will put thee among my Children, I will give thee a pleaſant Land.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the 25. Verſe Chriſts addreſſes to help them: the manner, the time: we ſhall now come to the 26. Ver. which containes the Diſciples apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him.</p>

            <p>And yet I cannot ſay, it was the diſcovery of Chriſt; it is ſaid they all ſaw him, but it is not ſaid they ſaw Chriſt, they ſaw him, but they knew not who it was: if ſo, they could not have beene troubled: As for Chriſt they knew they left him on the ſhore, and therefore could not conjecture that it was hee that was now upon the Sea.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Sometimes mens eyes are blinded with ignorance, and ſometimes bleered with Paſſion. <hi>Hagar</hi> cryes for water, and yet the Well was neare her; her eyes were ſo bleered with preſent Paſſion, that ſhe could not ſee the waters, though they were at hand.</p>

            <p>Chriſt comes here to help his People. he comes to deliver them, but they think him to bee a ghoſt, one that comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Iſraelites looked upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> God ſent him to be their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, but when their taske of brick was doubled, when their burthens were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, <hi>Moſes</hi> then appeares to them as a ghoſt, as a deſtroyer, rather than a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.

            <p>We ſee Reaſon doth correct ſenſe; if we put a ſtraight ſtick into the Water, ſence will give it to be crooked, the eye doth repreſent it crooked, but now reaſon corrects it, and concluds it ſtraight, and if reaſon correct ſenſe, why ſhould not Faith correct Reaſon?</p>

            <p>And theſe are the three times that Chriſt ſeems to appear as a Ghoſt to his own people.</p>
            <p>Now there are foure times Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as a Ghoſt to wicked men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he comes with his Fan in his hand, to purge and reform his Church; men look upon Reformation as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, And think Chriſt comes to deſtroy them, when he comes to reforme them, men may ſometimes look upon that as the greateſt evill, which yet is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their greateſt good. It is the Speech of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this place, That there ſhall be ſuch troubles ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about the fourth watch, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iore the end of all things, that men ſhall look upon Religion, ſhall I ſay, becauſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64789:97"/>of the troubles that it raiſes, when it comes to be ſetled in its Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<note n="s" place="margin">Res Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſma videtur.</note> they ſhall look upon Religion as a Ghoſt: Not becauſe Religion will hurt them, but hurt their ſins.</p>
            <p>How juſtly may that be applyed to us now, which was ſpoken of <hi>Iſrael, When I would have healed Iſrael, then the iniquity of Iſrael did appeare.</hi> So it is with us, when the Lord would heale us, and reforme us, then doth the iniquity of men, the malice, the pride, the hatred of the purity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, then doe all theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ppeare. What is the ground of all this trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us now? why are ſo many up in Arms,
<note n="*" place="margin">Vitia noſtra quia amamus, defendimus.</note> but to keep out Chriſt, in the Power and purity of his Ordinances. Reformation is now the Ghoſt, that hath frighted them into Arms, men that are afraid, they run unto their weapons; ſo they, frighted with the Ghoſt of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, get up weapons, put themſelves in armes to oppoſe it. So long as Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is looked upon as an enemy, it ſhall finde enemies enow, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is an enemy to nothing but their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>A ſecond time when he appeares as a Ghoſt to them
<note n="t" place="margin">Haec in eſt nobis perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitas, ut quae vere mala ſunt non timea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; ea quae nocere ne poſſunt formidemus. Muſc. in loc.</note> when he comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

They thank God, they are no Changlings, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not to change in a good way is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but to be unchangeable in a bad way, is damnable. To be unchangably evill, is to be as Divells are, for ever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and for ever miſerable. Firſt cleer your way to be good, and then glory in our unchangeableneſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">A third time, when Chriſt appears as a ghoſt to them, and that is, when they lie upon the bed of ſickneſſe, the bed of death, Oh then Chriſt is terrible, when a man ſhall lye upon his death bed,

            <p n="4">4 A fourth time, and that is at the day of judgement, when Heaven and Earth and all the world is on fire; then ſhall Chriſt appeare as a Ghoſt indeed full of terror to every wicked and ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We reade, that the wicked at that day,

            <p>This is all I ſhall ſay of the ſecond: the Diſciples thoughts and apprehenſions of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We come to the third; and that is the effects of theſe apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Which were two fold.

               <q>[They were troubled.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this was farre from Chriſts end, he came to helpe them, and not to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, to relieve them, not to diſquiet them; how came it to paſs that they were troubled? Certainly they were not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of deliverance, that was that which they deſired; but they were terrified at the manner of Chriſts comming to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt may come to helpe his people in ſuch a way, as yet the very means of helpe may be a terror to them. I ſay, Chriſt may come in ſuch a way to deliver his people, as yet the appearance of Chriſt may be a terror to them. It is the ſpeech of one upon this,

                  </gap>men ipſi horrent venientem.</note> Chriſt is comming here to helpe them, and yet they feare his approach.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in Egypt, <hi>Moſes</hi> came to helpe them, and yet they were afraid of his comming, they ſaw things went worſe with them then before, and therefore they deſired him to be gone and let them alone; they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64789:100"/>would rather continue in their former bondage, then indure the pains of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p>God delivered <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> out of priſon, but it was by an earthquake: a terrible way. So God doth ſometimes come to deliver his Church, but yet by earthquakes, by land-quakes, by great commotions, as is propheſied, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. and thought to be now in fulfilling.</p>
            <p>This is a terrible way, though a way of deliverance.</p>
            <p>We reade in <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.21. <hi>Fear not O land, bee glad and rejoyce, for the Lord will doe great things for you.</hi> It was a time of joy in reſpect of the deliverance God purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to work for them, but yet a time of feare, in reſpect of the manner and way which God might take to deliver them.</p>
            <p>You have an excellent Scripture for this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.5. <hi>By terrtble things in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe wilt thou anſwer us, oh God of our ſalvation, who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saints had been praying, and here they had ſome anſwer in their ſpirits, an aſſured confidence that God would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, yea, and anſwer them in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but yet by terrible things. <hi>By
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64789:100"/>terrible things in righteouſneſſe wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you looke into the word, you ſhall finde the wayes of Gods deliverance of his Churches, have yet for the moſt part beene terrible wayes. Iſrael was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their bondage in Egypt, but yet the way was terrible, the enemies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, &amp; they were to paſſe through the ſea for their deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daniel</hi> was delivered out of the hands of his enemies, but the way was terrible, he muſt be given into the pawes of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Lions, to be delivered from the hands of cruell men.</p>
            <p>The Three Children were delivered, but the way was terrible, by fire, from fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonah</hi> was delivered, but the way was terrible, by a Whale which ſwallowed him up; his devourer, is his deliverer.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt ſhall come to deliver his Church at the end of all things, you read how terrible the way is; <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25, &amp;c. <hi>There ſhall be ſignes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Starres, and upon the Earth diſtreſſe of Nations; the Sea and waters roaring, mens hearts failing them for feare, and for looking after the things that ſhall come upon the Earth, for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64789:101"/>of heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> A very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way; yet the way of deliverance, as followes: <hi>And when you ſee theſe things to come to paſſe, then lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Here was deliverance you ſee to the godly, but yet the way of deliverance was a terrible way.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee the Doctrine is plaine. Chriſt may come to helpe his people in ſuch a way, that the very meanes of helpe may be a terror to them.</p>

            <p>The man-childe of deliverance is not brought forth without pangs: ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours long in growing, are not removed without paine. Sometimes the fiering of

            <p>And therefore wee are not to bee too much caſt downe. God would have us to ſee deliverance even through deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and comfort through confuſion.

            <p>Had it not beene for our ſinnes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his Church might have been brought about in a more comfortable way, reformation might have been ſetled

            <p>And therefore we have cauſe to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it this day. We hope God is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the greateſt of his ſtrength, to deliver his poore bleeding and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church.

            <p>But yet, though the meanes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deliverance be ſo terrible, let us take heed that ſalvation it ſelfe become not a terror to us, though the phyſick be terrible, let health be deſirable: though the way God takes to reforme us be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, yet let not reformation it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a terror to us.</p>

            <p>You ſee this in the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> GOD had taken notice of the afflictions of his People in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and he came down to <hi>remove</hi> them; and for this end, he ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>deliver</hi> them.

            </p>
            <p>A ſtory which runs parallell with our Times, and (which is worſe) our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits too: Which of us, with them, doe not look upon the Beginnings of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance (becauſe of the paines and coſts of it) to be as bad as the Bottome of our ſufferings? And doe not many of us, wiſh, There never had been a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? doe we not wiſh; That they had never ſought to Deliver us? Are we not weary of our Deliverers? Nay, are wee not weary of our Deliverance? Rather content to be <hi>As we were,</hi> nay worſe; then to endure the Paines, to be at the Coſts, to run the hazard of a Deliverance?

            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee in <hi>Iacob;</hi> God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Deliver him; and yet you ſee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did deliver him, hee Increaſed both in his Fears and his Dangers; as you may ſee in the Story both of <hi>Lahan</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>Lahan</hi> followed him, and would be avenged on him, for taking away his gods.
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 32.6, 7.8.</note> And <hi>Eſau,</hi> he came out againſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64789:104"/>him, for to be revenged for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Birth-wright. An Hard Father, And a Cruell Brother! And <hi>God</hi> was in the way now of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Deliverance.</p>
            <p>So you ſee in <hi>David.</hi> God had a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Deliver him, as he had promiſed: But yet you
<note n="*" place="margin">i Sam. 23.26, 27, 28. 1 Sam. 24.3, 4 1 Sam. 26.2, 3.</note> ſee how God did Increaſe his Troubles, before he did deliver him; Inſomuch that he ſaith, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul.</hi> 1. Sam. 27.1. To ſuch a height were his troubles ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that now they had overſwelled his Faith, and in regard of the ſtrange procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Gods Providence to him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to doubt of the truth of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to him. <hi>I ſhall one day periſh,</hi>— I cannot ever hold out, I have eſcaped this time miraculouſly out of his hands, as you ſee in the former Chapter, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. But I ſhall one day be a prey to his cruelty, certainly I cannot ever hold out, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh</hi> — To this height did God raiſe histroubles, before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Iob.</hi> God intended to Deliver him. But yet you ſee,
<note place="margin">Quo magis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus appropin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, eo magis acuit dolores. Baez.</note> The neerer he grew to Deliverance out of Trouble, the more was his Trouble increaſed on him.</p>
            <p>And if you ſhould aske me, Why
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64789:104"/>God doth increaſe our Troubles, when he comes to Remove our Troubles; I would tell you: God doth it to make the Increaſe of our Troubles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The diſcovery of our hearts. So you ſee in the Eighth of <hi>Deutr.</hi> 16.17. where <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them the reaſon, why God led them Fourty yeers through the Wilderneſſe: It was
<note n="e" place="margin">Timorem auget ut noſtram fidem probaret, &amp; ſuam vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem declarat.</note> To try them, and to Prove them, and Diſcover what was in their hearts. Not but that God knew it: But God would have them to know it. And this was one reaſon here, why he did ſend his Diſciples to Sea, and ſuffered them to be toſſed, To diſcover their Spirit, their Faith, their feare, their Patience, their Impatience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence Troubles and Afflictions are called <hi>Gods Fanne,</hi> that will diſcover Wheat from Chaffe; and <hi>Gods Fining Pot,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> that will diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween droſſe and Gold, <hi>Gods Touch-ſtone,</hi> that will diſcover Counterfeit and True Coyne.</p>
            <p>Wee had never known <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith and Love; <hi>Davids</hi> Piety; Jobs Patience; <hi>Pauls</hi> Courage and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; If they had not been brought upon exerciſes. Nor ſhould wee ſo well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64789:105"/>either our ſinnes or our graces, our ſtrength, or our weakneſſe, if God did not exerciſe us with troubles and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>If Gods children ſhould ever lye in Garriſon, neither their ſtrength, nor their weakneſſe; their ſins, nor their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be known. And therefore God doth bring them out into the field, doth exerciſe them with many difficulties and troubles, that ſo they might be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both to themſelves, and to others. Hence you read in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>You are in heavineſſe, through many temptations, that the triall of your faith might be found to the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was upon this ground, GOD brought <hi>Iob</hi> into ſo many difficulties, that his Faith and Patience might be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Satan for ever confuted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. You know it wes the Devills argument concerning <hi>Job,</hi> (and it was true in the mayne) God ſaid, that <hi>Job was an holy and patient man.</hi> Why but (ſaith Satan) what thanks is there to him for that? he muſt needs be patient, who hath nothing to diſturbe his patience, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke impatience.</p>
            <p>And the Argument was true in the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64789:105"/>main, when all things which are fewll for patience are enjoyed, when a man hath what his heart can wiſh: what tryall of Patience?</p>
            <p>Therefore doth God bring <hi>Iob</hi> into the Field, exerciſe him with an hard Battell; wherein hee had not onely to deale with Satan, but his friends too, as enemies. Nay God himſelfe ſeemes alſo to joyn with Satan; not only by withdrawing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from him, but by poſſitive inflicting of diſpleaſure upon his ſpirit. <hi>Thou figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt mee with all thy terrours, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmest me with all thy waves. Iob</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>And all this while God increaſed his troubles to diſcover his heart.</p>
            <p>When God brings judgements and calamities on a nation, he is ſaid to ſift a nation, <hi>Amos.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Troubles are Gods ſieve.</hi> The greater the troubles, the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and finer is Gods ſieve: ſmal troubles, they are but a courſe ſieve; they will not bee able to diſcover the flower from the bran; much bran, notwithſtanding this ſifting will paſſe through. <hi>Orpha</hi> may goe farre with <hi>Ruth,</hi> but will not goe throughout. The Scribe came to Chriſt, and would have gone farre, if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him upon his ſolemne proteſtations,

               <hi>I will follow thee witherſoever thou goeſt:</hi> but when he heard it was a matter of paines and hardſhip, he muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lye with Chriſt in the fields,— <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Fowles of the ayre have neſts, but the Son of man hath not whereon to lay his head,</hi> then hee returnes home to his warme bed,

            <p>And as big profeſſions the young man made alſo:
<note place="margin">19 Matth. 16.</note> he would follow him too, but when it came to the diſcovery, that it was a matter of coſt to follow Chriſt, he was to goe <hi>ſell all and give to the poore,</hi> then he leaves him, though ſorrowing.

            <p>The <hi>Stony ground</hi> went far too;

            <p>Thus you ſee the many ſlender grounds and ends that weak and deceitfull ſpirits have, and doe propound to themſelves in their adhering to, and falling off from the cauſe of God: pitty it were that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo precious a thing, ſhould have ſuch aſſertors! to whoſe defence I know nothing ſo meane, but is too good to bee intruſted.

And this is the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>God doth often increaſe our troubles, when hee comes to remove our troubles; to diſcouver our hearts; that the thoughts of many hearts might bee revealed: that, as the Apoſtle ſayes of Hereſies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 19.

That the droſſe might bee knowne from the gold. the counterfeit from the true, the corrupt from the ſincere, the Chaſt from the Corne, the precious from the vile, the Tares from the Wheat.</p>
            <p>Which though it be not yet fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; yet I feare God will heighten our troubles, and increaſe our difficulties, till hee hath made further diſcoveries. Our deſire is rather, that God would uſe naturall Spirits for Spirituall purpoſes; ſtabliſh them we have, than to leſſen the number of them.

So much as comes into a trouble to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that, ſo much ſhall come into a deliverance to heighten that. The ſame proportion God obſerveth in difficulties, the ſame he alſo obſerves in deliverances. God will make the riſes of his people proportionable to their caſtings down: where he layes the foundation low, there he intends a proportionable ſtructure of mercy, to raiſe the building high. <hi>They who ſow in teares, ſhall reape in joy;</hi> &amp; their harveſt ſhall be as glorious as their ſeed time hath been uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>You ſee the difficulties of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, (which were ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in Egypt, and at the Red-ſea) did all come into the inlargement of their deliverance. If the ſtrait had not been ſo great, the inlargement had not beene ſo glorious: if the trouble had not been ſo ſad, the deliverance had not been ſo joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Reade the ſtory, and you ſhall finde that thoſe things which were additions to their troubles, were alſo made additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their deliverance.

            <p>When ſo many potent nations joyned together againſt <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> it did much increaſe the difficulty: when ſo many po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Kings united all their ſtrength and power together. But yet looke, and you ſhall finde this alſo increaſed their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.

            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> troubles were heightned at the Red Sea, that Gods praiſes might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo raiſed, when he came to the ſhoare. And ſo they were. Nothing doth more ſwell a mercy and deliverance, then our neceſſity of it. The greater the neceſſity the greater the mercy. And proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as our thoughts are raiſed with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of the mercy; ſo are our hearts raiſed in the returnes of praiſes. Men ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their wants to pray for mercy, wil be ſenſible of their injoyments, in praiſes to God for them.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad thing, when God muſt bee forced to make us miſerable, that hee might make us thankfull. If we could be more thankefull under deliverances, God would not make us ſo miſerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſſures. If our hearts could be but

This is a ſad thing, when God is inforced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our ſtripes, double our blowes, adde to our troubles when we are under them; that he might adde to our praiſes when wee are got out of them.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians! You have had experience of many mercies, of a late mercy; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from that treacherous plot, and bloody deſigne upon this City.

            <p>Beware, leſt your unthankfulneſſe for this, doe not cauſe God to make the next

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. If ſo, then let us not judge of Gods purpoſes by his preſent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of providence with us. God may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the troubles of his people, when yet he intends to remove the troubles of his people: as God may ſeeme to heale, when he means to deſtroy; to ſpeak peace and good in his works, when he intends evill and wrath in his word: ſo God may ſeeme to kill, when he intends to cure; to deſtroy, when he means to ſave; to wound, when he intends to heale.</p>
            <p>You know what God ſaid to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they were in great troubles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cruell and unmercifull hands of their enemies: their troubles increaſed. Yet ſaith he, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 29.11. <hi>I know the thoughts I think to thee: they are thoughts of peace, and not of evill, to give thee at the laſt an expected end;</hi> an end anſwerable to thy expectation? What a ſtrange thing was this? His wayes were warre, yet his thoughts were peace: his proceedings were evill, yet his purpoſes were good.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you at large, that Gods outward proceedings of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, are oftentimes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64789:114"/>to the Inward purpoſes of his Heart to them.</p>
            <p>Let us not then reaſon, much leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude according to Gods outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to his people, Suffer not your ſelves to be <hi>reaſon'd</hi> out of your Faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by any outward proceding toward you. When you ſee Evill in works, ſee good in the Word; when Death in the outward proceeding of God toward you, ſee Life in the Inward purpoſes of his heart to you.</p>

As Reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes againſt Senſe: So let Faith prevail againſt Senſe and Reaſon: and let Faith conclude God for you, when yet Senſe and Reaſon tells you, hee is againſt you. This is the life of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Doth God Increaſe our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when yet he intends to Remove our Troubles? Then this ſhould incourage us to <hi>Lift up our heads under the greateſt preſſures.</hi>

            <p>Deliverance is the Birth of Mercy. As never was there birth without Pangs: So Deliverance without Oppoſition and Trouble. Satan oppoſeth, wicked men oppoſe: But as Throws and Pangs are ſubſervient to the Birth: ſo will God make our Preſent Troubles to Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The ſharpeſt pangs and throws of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64789:115"/>the Church, have ever been the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fore-runners of ſome Childe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>As it was in the Waters of <hi>Betheſda.</hi> The waters were troubled, before they healed. The trouble of the water was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Cure in them: ſo that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and trouble, which doth ariſe in the time and expectations of our healing; will God turne to our further healing; what the Apoſtle ſaith of his Bonds, I may ſay of all the troubles that ariſe; <hi>the things that have happened to me,</hi>

            <p>It is our weakneſſe to be afraid of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and our wickedneſſe too.

            <p>Many are afraid of Satan when they are praying, who yet are never afraid of him when they are ſinning: Indeed when they ſinne they ſerve the devill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think he will not hurt them.

            <p>And yet we cannot but think, the reſt of the Paſſengers and Mariners might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome comfort by it: ſo far as they underſtood who it was that ſpake.

            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> It is good to be in the ſhip with the people of God, though it be on a ſtormy and troubleſome ſea.</p>
            <p>The Mariners found this to be true. They were in the ſhip with them, and therefore did partake of the common ſalvation. It is good to be in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in a good cauſe, though you meet

As it was with <hi>Mary</hi> in the loſſe of his Bodily preſence, <hi>She wept,</hi> and would not be comforted: Nay, though Angels did labour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, yet they could not. It is not all the Angels of heaven, that are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort a drooping ſoul, Chriſt but ſpeakes a word to her, — <hi>Mary.</hi> And her heart leaps. — <hi>Rabboni.</hi> My Lord: So is it with a ſoul that hath loſt the ſpirituall preſence of Chriſt. It is not all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in heaven and earth, can comfort the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64789:126"/>ſoul in the abſence of Chriſt; what is Gold in the abſence of God! What is the creature in the abſence of the Creator! All the world is but like a Feaſt without an Appetite, a Paradice without a Tree of Life. Nothing can fill up Chriſts room in the ſoul; The Preſence of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can make up the abſence of Chriſt; yet one word from Chriſt, one ſmile from heaven, And the ſoul is revived. <hi>Speak but the word, and thy ſervant ſhall be whole,</hi> ſaith the man in the Goſpel: So, Speak but the word, and this dead heart ſhall be raiſed: this dejected heart ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, this broken heart ſhall be bound up, this ſad heart ſhall be cheered, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Are we in outward troubles and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? why, it is the Word of Chriſt, that doth ſtay us, that doth cheare us, that doth ſupport us, that doth comfort us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19. <hi>In the multitude of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed thoughts within me, Thy comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſoul.</hi> Certainly the comforts from his Word. Yea ſaith he:— <hi>I had periſhed in mine affliction, but that thy Word did ſupport mee. Pſal.</hi> 119.50.92.</p>
            <p>The Word is full of Counſell, full of Comfort, full of Support, full of Help to a ſoul, in all his Troubles. Therefore
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64789:126"/>hath God left us a Word, that, it might be as <hi>a School</hi> to <hi>inſtruct</hi> us; a <hi>Star,</hi> or <hi>Sun,</hi> to <hi>guide</hi> us; a <hi>Rock</hi> to ſupport us; a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall</hi> to <hi>comfort</hi> us; a <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>ſecure</hi> us; and <hi>Armory</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> us in the evill day. The <hi>Word</hi> is as full of <hi>comfort,</hi> as the <hi>times</hi> are full of <hi>terror;</hi> the dayes are full of <hi>trouble:</hi> but the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is full of <hi>comfort.</hi> And it never ſpeakes more <hi>comfort</hi> to the Saints, then when the <hi>times</hi> ſpeak moſt <hi>trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Let this then direct us, whither to flie for comfort now, in theſe times of Trouble: Even to the Word of Chriſt. Enquire what VVord of comfort, Chriſt ſpeaks now to his Church, in this day of Trouble; and <hi>liſten to it, live upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is our fault, that the Noyſe of our Troubles and feares doe hinder us from hearing what Chriſt ſaith in his VVord to comfort us.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of the children of Iſrael, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 6.9. that when <hi>Moſes</hi> came to ſpeak Deliverance and Comfort to them, and told them, that God ſent him to that purpoſe, to deliver them: yet ſaith the Text, <hi>The children of Iſrael hearkened not to Moſes for Anguiſh of Spirit, and for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Bondage:</hi> So it is with us, Our Feares,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64789:127"/>and our Troubles, and Vnbeleevings, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſonings cry ſo loud in our eares, that wee cannot hear the Comfort that God doth now ſpeak to us, out of his Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, Did Chriſt ſpeak to us, as hee did to his Diſciples heere, then we might be comforted in our troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt doth ſpeak to us, as he did to them: VVhat did he ſay to them, but he ſaith to us alſo now, All we read was but this, — <hi>Be of good cheere; It is I? Be not afraid.</hi> He did not ſay, He would ſave them, Hee would helpe them, nor that hee would preſerve their ſhip, ceaſe the ſtorme, deliver them out of Trouble and Danger; onely hee ſaith, <hi>Bee of good cheere (It is I)</hi> I, that am your Saviour, your Lord, your Maſter. I, that ſent you out. <hi>All the reſt was the work of their Faith.</hi> Their Faith made out the reſt: even their Confidence in him. Now I ſay. This, and more then this doth Chriſt ſay to us now in our Trouble.</p>
            <p>How many words of Chriſt have wee, for this <hi>[Bee of good cheer?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh 14.1. Luk. 12.32. Iſay. 41.13. Iſay. 43.5.</note> 
               <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.] Fear not little flock. [Fear not thou worme Jacob,]</hi> I. I, that

And therefore we may reaſon out the reſt, as well as they: and where is now our Faith! That man is deafe, that heares not Chriſt ſay thus much now. And doth Chriſt ſay this? where then is our Faith, to reſt upon him, oh that this word might beget faith, and this Faith might again ſtrengthen it ſelf in this Word!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, Had wee a perticular Word of Chriſt, that God would now deliver England: wee could then finde a Bottom of Comfort, though our conditions lay farre lower then they are. But wee want that. Therefore are we oppreſſed with feares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You have as much Word for the deliverance of the Church now, as the Diſciples had for the Preſervation of the Ship. Yet they beleeved the one, reſting only upon the Nature of a Saviour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a word: and why ſhould we doubt of the other, though we had no word.</p>
            <p>There may be a Reſting upon Gods Name for a mercy, Though you have never a Promiſe for it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Hee
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64789:128"/>that walketh in darkneſſe, and ſees no light:</hi> no light of any Promiſe, to tell him how things ſhall be: <hi>Yet let him truſt upon the Name of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and ſtay himſelf upon his</hi> GOD. There is <hi>Truſt</hi> without <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> He that Reſts upon the <hi>Name of the Lord;</hi> that is, his Mercy, Goodneſſe, Truth, Love, Reſts upon that which is <hi>the ſpring</hi> of all the Promiſes: <hi>the ground,</hi> and <hi>foundation,</hi> whereon the Promiſe ſtands, and that into which all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are <hi>reſolved, viz. The Name of God. Pſal.</hi> 62.8. The Prophet exhorts to truſt in God. And upon what Ground? He alleageth no Particular Promiſe; but tells you of Gods <hi>Generall Nature, Ver.</hi> 11. God hath ſpoken, that <hi>Power</hi> belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. And <hi>Ver.</hi> 12.— And unto thee belongeth <hi>Mercy.</hi> And thereupon hee truſteth. God was <hi>Powerfull,</hi> and able to Deliver. And God was <hi>Mercifull,</hi> and ready to help, and thereupon he truſted.</p>
            <p>And have not we <hi>as much</hi> for a <hi>Ground</hi> of our Faith, as This? You read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18.19.—<hi>The Eye of the Lord is on them that feare him. and upon them that Hope in his Mercy: to Deliver their ſoul from death.</hi> Here is <hi>Hope;</hi> and that not exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Promiſe in Particular, but upon

               <hi>Gods Nature</hi> in the Generall. <hi>(Hope in his Mercy.)</hi> And yet ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon ſuch; to Deliver them from death.</hi> Pſal. 147.11. — <hi>The Lord delighteth in them, that feare him; in them that Hope in his Mercy.</hi> Mark you: There is the ſame again, though a Promiſe be wanting; yet God delights in thoſe, <hi>that hope in his Mercy,</hi> in the Generall.</p>
            <p>So; Though we had not a Promiſe, yet we have a Word to diſcover God to us: we have the Name of God; his Nature; his Properties, to reſt upon for Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And this is as good a Foundation, as the Diſciples had now for their Faith upon the Sea.</p>

Let our Enemies but ſhew as much for their confidence, as we may doe for ours; and wee will give up the Bucklers.</p>
            <p>Wee will firſt lay downe two grand Rules, which Divines lay down, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:64789:130"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Rule.</hi> What God hath done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his people in diſtreſſe, is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a Promiſe to us, in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Now God hath ſupported, Delivered others of his people in former times.</p>
            <p>And this is Equivalent to a Promiſe to us, that God will ſupport and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us.</p>
            <p>Hee hath helped his Church in their ſtraits, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Eſthers</hi> time. And that, which God did to others of his People in diſtreſſe, is equivalent to a Promiſe to us; as our Divines ſay in their interpretation of Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And this ſeems to have a foundation in Scripture too. <hi>Jobs</hi> Deliverance out of Trouble is made the Ground of our wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God for Deliverance out of Trouble alſo. You ſhall ſee it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7. to 11. In the ſeventh Verſe, the Apoſtle exhorts them unto patience, under all their afflictions, and Croſſes, upon this Ground, becauſe God will deliver them, if they wait on him. Why, But how ſhall we know that? Why ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: He hath delivered others of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the ſame Caſes: And ſo will he you. <hi>You have heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64789:130"/>of Job, and what end God made with him. (i. e.)</hi> How God delivered him out Trouble: <hi>And therefore be you patient,</hi> and wait for the ſame Deliverance.</p>
            <p>And hereupon the Pſalmiſt reaſons. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.4, 5. <hi>Our Father j truſted in thee, and thou deliveredſt them: they cryed unto thee, and were not confounded.</hi> And what is the meaning of that; but that the Church doth take up an Argument from Gods dealing with his Church in former times, To truſt God for the like Mercy for themſelves, being in the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Rom. 15.4. <hi>What ever things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they are written for our learning; that wee, through Patience, and comfort in the Scripture, might have hope.</hi> Marke there (what things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) not only Promiſes, but Hiſtories of Gods dealings to his Church, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore written, that we might have hope. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> That we might depend on God, in the like condition.</p>
            <p>He relieved <hi>Iacob, David, Iehoſhaphat, Iob,</hi> the Churches of God, &amp;c. That all theſe might be in ſtead of <hi>promiſes</hi> to us, to inable us to depend on God, in the like diſtreſſes.</p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:64789:131"/>
            <p>So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10.—<hi>They that know thy name will trust in thee.</hi> And why? He doth not ſay, becauſe thou haſt made them ptomiſes; though this be true. But he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe thou Lord</hi>

            <p>And this is the firſt rule: what ever God hath done to others of his people in diſtreſſe, is equivalent to a promiſe to us, in the ſame condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> What God promiſeth to any of his people, he promiſeth to all his people in an equall eſtate.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64789:131"/>if he brought a famine, peſtilence, or ſword upon the land: <hi>if his people did humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeeke his face, he would heare from heaven and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their ſinnes, and heale their land.</hi> As you ſee at large, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.37. to 40.</p>
            <p>Here was a promiſe made to <hi>Solomon.</hi> Now if you look into 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.8, 10. You ſhall ſee how <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> makes uſe of this promiſe, and ſues it out.—</p>
            <p>Art not thou our God, who haſt ſaid: <hi>If the ſword, judgement, or pestilence come upon thy people, and thy people cry unto thee in their affliction, then thou wilt heare from heaven, and helpe, and deliver them.</hi> Why ſaith he, Behold now the enemies which are come againſt us, &amp; judge them, Lord our God: for we have no might againſt this great company; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are up to thee.</p>
            <p>Where you ſee the rule confirmed; that what ever God promiſeth to any of his people in any age of the world; he promiſeth to all his people in all ages in an equall ſtate, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the like condition. Vpon this ground <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> made uſe of this promiſe which was made to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> being in the like diſtreſſe he goes to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64789:132"/>ſue out the promiſe, and lookes for the performance of it.</p>
            <p>I will give you another place, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 5.6. <hi>I will be with thee, I will not faile thee nor forſake thee.</hi> This you know was a particular promiſe made to <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> Yet the Apoſtle, (who beſt knew the minde of the giver,) he brings this promiſe into the common ſtock, that ſeemed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated; and ſhewes that this is part of the Saints riches, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſſe,</hi> for he hath ſaid, <hi>He will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Yea, you may ſay: he hath ſaid ſo to <hi>Ioſhuah:</hi> but where to me? And indeed this could not be anſwered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you grant this rule to be true; that whatever God hath promiſed to his Church, or any of his people, in other ages of the world; he hath promiſed to his Church, and all his people to the end of the world, provided they be in like ſtate, in equall condition, whence we ſay, That generall promiſes may bee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly applyed: and particular, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. That is, what ever promiſe you find to one godly man, as godly: or to his Church, as to his Church. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to all. God carrying himſelfe to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64789:132"/>all alike, all of you being under the ſame covenant, and to deale with the ſame God, who is impartiall in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his love and mercy.</p>
            <p>And now then bring downe this Rule, and ſee if it be not ſomething to us. He hath promiſed to ſave the oppreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5. He hath promiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his people out of trouble. The Scripture is full. He promiſed, that no Weapon formed againſt the Church ſhould proſper: a promiſe to the Church of the Gentiles: He ſaid, <hi>He would make Ieruſalem a burthenſome ſtone, that who ever lifteth at it ſhall be cruſhed to pieces, though all the Nations of the earth ſhould be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together againſt it, Zach.</hi> 12.3. Reade <hi>Iſay</hi> 43. v. 3, 4. I <hi>will give men for thee.</hi>— And <hi>Micah</hi> 4.11, 12.—</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay of theſe places? are they uſefull to us? Or of no uſe. Of no uſe we cannot ſay, for the Apoſtle tels us, that <hi>All Scripture is written for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; that we through patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation thereof might have hope.</hi> And if uſefull, then they are to incourage us, to truſt upon the ſame God, that God will be the ſame to us, that he hath beene to others. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.7. The children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64789:133"/>were commanded to tell the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which God had done to his people in Egypt, at the Red-ſea, in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; to their children, and they to their children, &amp;c. And for what reaſon?— <hi>That they might ſet their hope in God,</hi> V. 7. Why what is that to them? Why, they were to learne to truſt in God and hope in God for the like, if they were brought to the ſame ſtraights. And certainly God would not have us hope, if he had not a purpoſe to do the like.</p>
            <p>Two things there be that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſappoint.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Prayer.</item>
               <item>2 Faith.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt Prayer. For ſo he ſaith,—<hi>When ſaid I to the ſeed of Jacob at any time: ſeek my face in vaine?</hi> Iſay 45.19. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he hath no purpoſe to give, he will not have his people to beg. You ſee he gives <hi>Jeremy</hi> a diſcharge, <hi>Pray not thou for this people, neither lift cry or prayer for them, for</hi> I <hi>will not heare thee., Jer.</hi> 7.16. And <hi>Samuel</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> Pray no more, mourne no more for <hi>Saul. Pſal.</hi> 66. <hi>ult. Bleſſed be God, that hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from m.</hi> If God turne not away prayer, he will never turn
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64789:133"/>away his mercy from us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith or Hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.6. <hi>They ſhall not be aſhamed that hope in thee:</hi> which they muſt if they faile of the thing hoped for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.28. <hi>The hope of the righteous ſhall be gladneſſe.</hi> So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the ſecond Rule. So that you ſee we have ſomething comes neere a particular word for our deliverance. Give me leave to adde two more inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to theſe Rules.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Incouragement. We have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar word for the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: and I am ſure that ſpeakes no terror to us now. This doth no way wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our faith for <hi>Englands</hi> deliverance at this time. He who believes and prayes for the deſtruction of Antichriſt, ſhall not any way hurt or hinder <hi>Englands</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance now.</p>
            <p>Well, we have a particular word that Antichriſt ſhall downe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Babylon the great, is fallen, is fallen.</hi> Indeed he is not yet down, but he is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrook in the threatning, and he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to fall: he is weakned in the pillars whereupon he ſtood, <hi>Germany, Spaine,</hi> which is a great earneſt to us, his end is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64789:134"/>comming. And now, he that reſts upon a word for the deſtruction of Antichriſt, ſhall not finde it any hinderance to his faith, in the believing the deliverance of <hi>England.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="4">4 Incouragement. We have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular word, that God will, before the end of all things make his Churches glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>Iſay</hi> 5.4. throughout: read 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Oh thou afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted! I will lay thy ſtones with faire colours, and thy foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Saphir.—And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the peace of thy children. Iſay</hi> 62.1, 2. &amp;c. <hi>For Sions ſake</hi> I <hi>will not hold my peace, and for Jeruſalems ſake</hi> I <hi>will not reſt, untill the righteouſneſſe thereof goe forth as bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ſalvation thereof as a Lampe that burneth; and the Gentiles ſhall ſee thy righteouſneſſe, and all Kings thy glory. And thou ſhalt be called by a new name,—Thou ſhalt alſo be a crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord</hi>—Of which places I may ſay as the Eunuch to <hi>Philip,—Speaketh the Prophet this of himſelfe, or of ſome other?</hi> So ſpeaketh the Prophet, theſe glorious things of the Church paſt, or the Church to come. Of the Church paſt it cannot
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64789:134"/>be; for hitherto it hath been (like <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark on the waters, like the ſhip on a ſtormy ſea) conflicting with inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table troubles and difficulties.</p>
            <p>Though ſhe hath had her reſpites and breathings, yet ſhe hath ſtill beene held down and humbled, toſſed, and afflicted, under bondage and perſecution. And therefore it cannot bee meant of the Church paſt, and if not muſt be meant of the Church to come.</p>
            <p>And is it to come, that God will make his Church thus glorious, <hi>That her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall fall before her.</hi>—Will God do this yet before the end.—</p>
            <p>And is the end of all things at hand? Are we now fallen into the laſt ſands? why this is ſomething to ſpeak incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to us. And this is from a word.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee, Chriſt ſpeaks incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to us, as well as he did to his Diſciples here. He ſpeakes incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his word, by his workes, by his promiſes, his proceedings: Every way he ſpeaks incouragement: and if you die, die with this confidence; That God hath laid the foundation of the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, though the oppoſitions ſwell never ſo high. God takes it well at our
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64789:135"/>hands, when we do entertaine and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good thoughts of him towards his people.—He delights in them, that hope in his mercy.—Though you have never a promiſe, yet to hope upon Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his love to his Church. And there is ground enough of hope from that, even his love to his Church.</p>
            <p>If you looke but upon what hee hath done to compaſſe a Church, nay, what hath ſuffered, how he hath ſhed his blood for her; All this would afford us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our hope. Will he do ſo much to purchaſe her, and will he now loſe her.</p>
            <p>It is moſt ſutable to the Goſpell, and moſt ſutable to our relations to God, yea, and expectations from God; nay, and moſt ſutable to a Chriſtian ſpirit, rather to <hi>dye over-hoping</hi> then <hi>over-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We can never over-hope Gods thoughts of love and mercy to his Church &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor his purpoſes and promiſes to them. And therefore let it be ſaid of us, as twas of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.—<hi>All theſe died in faith, not having received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: but having ſeen them afarre off, were perſwaded of them, and imbraced them.</hi> Let us doe our worke in our generation, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64789:135"/>leave our hopes, and the remainder of the work (if any remaine) them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt thing. <hi>viz.</hi> The way that Chriſt took to comfort and Incourage his Diſciples, againſt fears and dangers. — <hi>[He ſpake to them.]</hi> A word from Chriſt is able to raiſe up up the drooping ſpirits of his people in trouble.</p>

            <p>As the evills of his people are many, ſo the Salvations of his people are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. if wee have a thouſand troubles, hee hath a thouſand ſalvations. As hee hath more bleſſings than one, ſo hath he more ſalvations than one. He ſaves our ſoules from ſinne; and there is mercy more than enough for the greateſt of ſinnes,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.14.</note> and ſinners. Hee ſaves our bodies from Troubles; and there can bee no Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles above the ſafeties of God. He is not a Saviour onely, but an All-ſufficient, an Almighty Saviour. Not onely a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but a perfect Redeemer; yea a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64789:137"/>Redeemer.— With him is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Redemption,</hi> Pſalm. 130.7. Full troubles, full redemption; Overflowing evills, over flowing redemption. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Creatures can never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſalvations of God. Nor men, nor devills can make us more miſerable, than God is mercifull: nor lay us ſo low, but everlaſting armes can raiſe us up.</p>
            <p>Are men full of malice? God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of mercy. Are they mighty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy? God is more mighty to ſave. Do they multiply our troubles? God can multiply our ſupports, our comforts, our deliverances. You can never bee in ſuch a diſtreſſe; but God is able to proportion your deliverance to your diſtreſſe. With him is power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.</p>
            <p>Gods reliefes are not onely ſutable, but they are proportionable to the neceſſities of his people. And the grounds hereof are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. Firſt, Becauſe they are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes of God, the Helps of God: That which God doth he doth throughly, hee doth to purpoſe. Men may doe things overtly, ſlightly, but ſo doth not God: what he doth, he doth throughly. Gods Helps are through-helps, full-helps. Men
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64789:137"/>may be too weak to relieve us; their helps may be too ſhort: But ſo are not the helps of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The helps of Gods people doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from Gods Mercy; Bowells of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Now you know, what a man doth out of Love, he doth Throughly, he doth Fully. All that God doth to his people, is out of Love. Power and Love can doe all. Thoſe two Attributes, which God doth chiefly exerciſe in the relieving of his people, doe ſpeak the Reliefs of God Proportionable to their Neceſſities. What cannot Infinite Power, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love doe? Mercy alone would afford ſutable helpe: But it muſt be Power with Mercy, that muſt afford Proportionable help. Gods Mercy ſuits helpe to our Neceſſities; and his Power proportions it. His Mercy is an Almighty-Mercy. Wee cannot ſeparate them in God, though they are ſeparated in Men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his helps are proportionable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come from infinite Power, and are the Iſſues of Infinite Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Then, when ever you are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, look towards God alone for helpe in your diſtreſſes, <hi>lift up your eyes to the hills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's our ſin, and our folly too, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64789:138"/>the Fountain, and run to the ſtream: to forſake God, and goe to the creature. <hi>A</hi> ſinne which God never fail'd to puniſh: And the puniſhment hath been ſutable to the ſin. In ſtead of ſuccour, they have gotten ſhame; in ſtead of comfort, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confuſion. You may read it. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Why gaddeſt thou about ſo much to change</hi> thy way, <hi>thou ſhalt be aſhamed of Egypt, as thou waſt aſhamed of Aſſyria, yea thou ſhalt goe forth from him, with thine hands upon thy head, for the Lord hath reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thy confidences, and thou ſhalt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God loves to Blaſt men, in their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Confidences, we have had the ſad experience of it. Diſappointment and ſhame, are the Deſerved ends of creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts: It ſhould now be our wiſedome (out of conviction of the emptineſſe of all Creature-Reliefs, and experience of the vanity of them) to goe alone to him, who can alone relieve us: And to ſay with them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. who never found ſuccour till then — <hi>Aſhur ſhall not</hi> ſave us: <hi>wee will not ride upon horſes: neither will we ſay any more to the work</hi> of our hands: <hi>Yee are our gods: for in thee the fatherleſse ſindeth mercy.</hi> Or with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.12.

            <p>Help cannot come ſo ſoon as wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Or there may be mountains of difficulties, that lie between us and them. Or their trouble may be too bigge for us to help. But it is not ſo with God. No diſtance of place; for he is in all places.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64789:139"/>Hence the Pſalmiſt ſaith, — <hi>Thou art a preſent helpe in trouble;</hi> becauſe he is ever preſent. No <hi>Iordan</hi> can hinder him. There was a Sea betwixt Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here; yet this could not hinder, or keep him from ſaving them. It muſt have hindred the reliefs of men: They could but have ſtood upon the ſhore, and wept over them, pittied them, pray'd for them: but it could not hinder Chriſt. Though there be a Sea betwixt Chriſt &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet he can either dry up, or divide the Sea; as he did the Red-ſea and <hi>Iordan:</hi> Or he can walk upon the Sea: a Sea cannot hinder him; as I have ſhewed.

            <p>Well then, let it be our wiſedome, in all our ſtraits and neceſſities. 1. To turn our ſelves alone to God for help. 2. To Reſt in Gods help alone. Vſe the helps of creatures, but reſt in the helps of God. So did <hi>David.</hi> Pſal. 108.12. Hee had provided help, as if there had not been a God in heaven: and yet ſo reſted on God, as though he had not a man in the field.

Chriſtians! let us learn the ſame leſſon, God hath weakned our arme of fleſh, that wee might ſtrengthen the arme of faith.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64789:140"/>Gods people. The more we have been we akned in creatures, the more wee have ſtrengthened our ſelves in God. I am ſure, we have ſeen more of God in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then ever we did in our ſtrength.</p>
            <p>What a wonder was it, that when our Armies were loſt; <hi>Briſtoll</hi> taken; none in the field to oppoſe them; they were in the top of their ſtrength; and might in all probability, have come even to the Gates of this City.

            <p>And this ariſeth, not ſo much from the greatneſſe of our ſtraits, as from the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſpirits under them. We are too big in our ſucceſſes, and too little in our loſſes: we are too high when things go well, and too low when things go ill. Men that are proud in ſucceſſes, are ſure to be as baſe in loſſes.

<pb facs="tcp:64789:141"/>more offers it ſelf from the words.</p>
            <p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifies three things.</p>

            <p>Have faith in God. The ſame word, that ſignifies comfort, ſignifies confidence. To ſhew us, that all comfort in God in times of trouble, doth ariſe from confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God in the time of trouble. No more confidence then you have, no more comfort you have. We have ſo little comfort in our trouble, becauſe we have ſo little confidence. We want comfort, the reaſon is, becauſe we have miſplaced our confidence. God hath blaſted our carnall confidences, that he might be our only ſtay now in times of trouble. While we have others to go to, we will not go to God: whiles we have Bulwarkes of our owne, we will not take Towre in God: Whiles we have any thing elſe to reſt on, wee will never anchor on the Rock. Would you have comfort from the Name, from the Attributes of God? Would you have comfort from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, from the Covenant of God? Let
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64789:142"/>God have confidence from you, and you ſhall have comfort from him. Aſſure your ſelves, ſo much confidence as you lay upon God, ſo much comfort you ſhall have from God.</p>
            <p>But yet there is ſomething more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from the word. <hi>[Be of good cheere, be of good courage, be of good confidence.]</hi> You ſee before Chriſt wold allay the tempeſt without, he applies himſelf firſt to quiet the tempeſt within. There was as great a tempeſt in the ſhip, in the hearts of the Diſciples, as there was in the ſea, <hi>Iſay</hi> 57.20. Their hearts were like the ſea, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up nothing but mire and dirt; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, feares, and unbeliefe. Here was the greateſt tempeſt.
<note n="w" place="margin">Non pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum res ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſas tollit, ut poſtea ſuos quietos red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra. Muſc.</note> Chriſt applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to lay this; to quiet their ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did quiet the ſea. And this for three reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe that this was the root of their troubles, even their lowneſſe of ſpirit; their diffidence and diſtruſt in God. All the troubles without had not troubled them, if they had not had an unbelieving, diſtruſting heart within. Hence <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> upon this place.
<note n="x" place="margin">Timor non habet cauſam ex rebus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfis ſed ex diffidentia, &amp; animi imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate. Muſc.</note> Feare doth not ariſe ſo much from troubles without, as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64789:142"/>diſtruſts and weakneſſe within.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe the greateſt trouble was that within. The other did but in danger the body, this the ſoule. The minde was moſt oppreſſed:
<note n="y" place="margin">Mentes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictorum ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumodo fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia pacifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Muſc.</note> and therefore Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes himſelfe, that the minde might be firſt relieved. <hi>Bono animo eſtote,</hi> Be of good comfort. Chriſt applyes himſelfe firſt to ſuccour that part, that doth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour under any trouble: and that is the minde. If once the minde be ſet right, the heart cheered, &amp; ſtrengthned: troubles will eaſily be borne.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Becauſe, till their hearts were raiſed up to believe they were not fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy. God loves to put his people into a poſture for mercy, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow mercy on them.</p>
            <p>They were not in fit poſture for God to work, till he had raiſed up their hearts to beleeve and expect.</p>
            <p>Its an obſervation, that
<note n="z" place="margin">Nunc vero, etſi opportur num erat fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendi auxilii tempus, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Chriſtus apparuit, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, ſalutem diſtert quae in manu habuit. Calvin.</note> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> hath upon this Verſe.—Although it was now a fit time for Chriſt to helpe: yet the tempeſt is not laid, becauſe his Diſciples were not yet awaken'd to pray and beleeve in his mercy. Therfore (faith hee) wee muſt know, it is not without
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64789:143"/>cauſe, that God doth often times deferre that helpe which he is ready to beſtow. God loves to have his people in a poſture of mercy, before he doe beſtow it. Hee would lay the tempeſt within, the ſtorme in their ſoules: he would lay their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unbelieving thoughts, and put them on, to believe, to hope, to expect, to pray for mercy, before they had it. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies God beſtowes upon his people, he is willing ſhould come, in a believing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way: therefore doth God ſhut his hand ſometimes, and with-hold his help, that we might believe: And here is work for faith. And therefore doth hee make obſtructions in the breaſt of the promiſe, that we ſhould ſuck, that we ſhould pray.</p>
            <p>Hee beſtowes mercy on wicked men without asking, hee feedes and cloathes them; cauſeth the Sunne to ſhine on the bad as well as good; but theſe are the mercies of a generall providence: not diſtinguiſhing mercies: of generall boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not of ſpeciall love. But the mercies he beſtowes on his owne, God is willing they ſhould come in as fruits of prayer, and as performance of promiſes: And then are they mercies indeed. The way of comming in is a greater mercy then the mercy it ſelfe.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:64789:143"/>
            <p>My brethren, we are in a ſad condition: We expect mercy, we looke for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But doe you pray? Doe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? Doe you wait? Remember this. God will put his people in a poſture fit to receive, before he will beſtow mercy: in a frame fit for deliverance, before he will deliver them.</p>
            <p>Mercy is never fit for you, till you be fit for mercy. Let the work of God goe better on within, in your ſpirits, &amp; Gods work will go better on without, abroad in the land. Interruptions, obſtructions, delayes abroad, are from hence, becauſe that there are all theſe within. Let us not only expect, but prepare, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. —<hi>Looking for, and haſtning the comming of the day of the Lord.</hi> Many will look for a thing which they will not haſten. Why, what is haſtning? The day is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; How can we haſten it? The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, That we ſhould haſten the day, but that we ſhould haſten or prepare our ſelves for the day. Therefore let us not only wait for mercy, but haſten to it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it. Now that we may thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the day, foure things are requiſite. 1. That we humble. 2. That we beleeve. 3. That we be mighty in prayer. 4. That
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64789:144"/>we be ſincere in our reformings.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the firſt part of the incouragement: we now come to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <q>[Be not afraid.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> God would not have the hearts of his people ſink under any affliction or trouble.</p>
            <p>They were in a great trouble: yet he incourages them; Be not afraid. Hence wee heare it ordinarily, <hi>Feare not thou worme Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay 41.14. Iſay 7.4.8.12 Iſay 43.1.5. Rev. 2.10. Luke 2.32.</note>

Thus GOD would ſteele the hearts of his people againſt baſe feares, though their troubles be great, yet he would not have their hearts to ſink under them. And that firſt, Becauſe this is offenſive to God. It's a great wrong we doe to God, to ſuffer our hearts to be caſt downe in times of trouble. You have a God who is able to relieve you, be you never ſo low; Nay, a God that is willing to helpe you: for he is a God of mercy; and all this mercy is for you; all this power is for you; you have a God who hath purpoſed to helpe you, he had purpoſes of good from all eternity to you. You have a God who
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64789:144"/>hath promiſed to helpe you: how many promiſes hath God made to you.—</p>
            <p>Nay; And you have had Experience of his Goodneſſe, both towards others, and towards your ſelves; It hath been a Tryed Goodneſſe, an Experienced good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore how doe wee wrong God, when we ſuffer our hearts to ſinke, in the dayes of Evill? Chriſtians ſhould be tender of Gods glory: you have need to take heed of bringing an ill Report upon God, as if he ſhould not have regard to to help his own People. This gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of hard thoughts to the men of the World.</p>
            <p>You have a tender expreſſion in <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8.22. — <hi>I was aſhamed to require of the King a band of Souldiers and horſemen to helpe me againſt the enmy; Becauſe wee had ſpoken to the King, ſaying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good, that ſeek him: But his power and his wrath is againſt all them that forſake him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark you here. Hee was in a Great ſtrait; There was great danger; He fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the enemy, yet he was aſham'd to ask any helpe: Why? Becauſe hee had ſaid to the King,— Certainly God will

And therefore, leſt hee ſhould any way Diſhonour God, and give the King occaſion to ſuſpect that God would not Preſerve them: he would rather venture all upon God in danger, then give the King ſuch occaſion of ſuſpition.

You ſhall ſee there the people were in ſome danger, and they let feare worke, when indeed faith, ſhould have worked. And as it is the nature of feare, it turnes a man from God, and from the promiſe, ſo it did them, and they betook themſelves to their owne forecaſts and proviſions: they would go downe to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt for help, as you ſee in the firſt Ver. They truſted in the ſhadow of Egypt, Egypt was a well ſpread tree, the boughs were great and large, and they promiſed to themſelves much ſecurity under the ſhadow of her boughes, they thought it
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64789:148"/>would have kept out the ſtorme. And though God now told them, that in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, and confidence, ſhould be their ſtrength, and that in returning and reſt they ſhould be ſaved: though God inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe to be their ſecurity, and ſet the ſecurity in himſelfe, againſt all they feared, yet notwithſtanding; all this was no ſecurity for them, their fears ſtill worked above their faith, and all that God ſaid, or was, was too little to be their ſecurity. Nay, though he tels them in the ſeventh Verſe, your ſtrength is to ſit ſtill, and it is worthy taking notice of; the word which God uſeth there for ſtrength,

            <p>Take another place in <hi>Iſay</hi> 7. You may reade, of a confederacy between the King
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64789:149"/>of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to come up againſt <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And in the ſecond Verſe you read, how <hi>the hearts of the men of Judah were moved, even as the trees of the wood are moved with the winde.</hi> Now in this their feare and danger God ſends a Prophet to them, to tell them he would bee their ſecurity if they would truſt on him, the third and fourth Verſes, <hi>Be quiet, fear not, neither be fainthearted,— I will helpe you,</hi>—Verſe 7. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, their feare prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their faith, whereupon God ſends the Prophet againe in the tenth Verſe, and bids the King <hi>Ask a ſigne, either in the depths below, or height above,</hi>—That is, if he deſired to have his faith confirmed by any viſible ſigne, either in Heaven or Earth, God would condeſcend ſo farre to the weakneſſe of his faith to afford it to him; but yet his feares prevailed againſt his faith, and againſt all the ſecurity God offered, and he puts all this off very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, Verſe 12. <hi>I will not ask a ſigne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I tempt God.</hi> One would thinke he ſpake well, he would not tempt God in asking a ſigne, he would beleeve on his bare word: doth not Chriſt blame the Scribes and Phariſees for asking a ſigne?

            <p>And ſo you ſee feare is a heart infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſin, it betrayes the ſuccours which God tenders; God, and all God is too little to ſecure an unbelieving man.</p>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64789:150"/>ſtrengthnings, 1. Our weaknings I ſay, feare is an army in battalia againſt it ſelfe; the heart doth arme the head, and the head uſeth all its enginery to batter the heart, the heart makes uſe of the head to heighten a danger, and that againe layes battery againſt the heart to leſſen that.</p>
            <p>Hee needs no enemies without, who hath a fearefull heart within; how can he ſtand out againſt enemies from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that is not able to ſtand againſt it ſelfe. This is the nature of fear, (where courage leſſens difficulties, and makes great things conquerable; ſuch a ſpirit looks through a leſſening glaſs, and ſees great dangers to be ſmall; the heart ſtill riſeth above the difficulty.) This is the nature of feare it looks through a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying glaſſe, and makes ſmall dangers great, and unreſiſtable. Aſſure your ſelves, feare will make a man weake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the proviſions of ſtrength, your forts are nothing, if you retaine your feares, you will be naked in the midſt of armes, weak in the midſt of ſtrength; fear is an armory of weapons againſt it ſelfe.

            <p n="1">1. They will make a man ſhie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Cauſe of God; You ſee <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and many of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, They believed, but durſt not confeſſe him, for feare of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="274" facs="tcp:64789:151"/>
            <p n="2">2. Fear will make a man-decline and bawk the Cauſe of God; the Rulers were afaid to acknowledge Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if they had done ſo, the <hi>Romans</hi> would have come and taken away their place and nation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fear will blind the underſtaning, &amp; hinder us from decerning good from evil, and evil from good: It is a Maxime, Sin in the affection will breed Error in the underſtanding, a corrupt heart will cauſe a corrupt head; feare in the heart will cauſe darkneſſe in the minde; It is a hard thing for a man under the power of any ſinfull paſſion, either by-aſſed with corrupt affections, or blinded with corrupt paſſions, to judge of the truth and juſtneſſe of any cauſe, though it be never ſo evident; Men in feare are apt to judge thoſe things good, which yet are evil, and they themſelves would ſo acknowledge, if they ſtood upon even ground, if the feares and dangers had not got the hill of them.—</p>
            <p>And I believe this is a great ground of mens judgings in theſe times; They think, if they ſhould acknowledge things as they are, they ſhould be at great coſts for the preſent, and run great hazards
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64789:151"/>for future, and therefore they will rather ſmother the Light and Evidences they have, then let in more, to their danger and coſt. Thus our enemies make us drive their mills with our owne breath, and doe their worke with our own hands— a fair policie— <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> uſed to ſay of <hi>Cyneas,</hi> That he had gained more Cities with his eloquence, then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had done with his ſword: It is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to expect moſt venom where there is moſt Art; the Spider hath much Art— but — yet a great deale of poyſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth ſnare that this feare brings on us, it doth not only blind our eyes, that we cannot ſee the Cauſe of God, and when we ſee it make us ſhie to acknowledge it, nay, prevail with a man to bawk and decline it. But it will make us deny and forſake the cauſe of God too; and here might be examples enough: many there are, who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Chriſt, denyed his truth, truth profeſſed, truth preached, truth in ſome meaſure contended for, and all for feare of men. You know the ſad ſtories of <hi>Peter, Spira,</hi> of <hi>Cranmer</hi>— It is an eaſie matter to make him who is under the power of ſinfull feares, any thing to

               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The appearance of Chriſt to the Soul, in any ſad Condition is a Reſurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The preſence of CHRIST in any trouble, calamity, or diſtreſſe, is Comfort and incouragement to the Soul. We cannot inſiſt upon all theſe which we have named, we will therfore contract our ſelves, and give you theſe two in one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The preſence and appearance of CHRIST to the Soul, in any ſad condition, is to the Soul as a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead.</p>
            <p>We will ſhew the truth of this in four ſad conditions, the Saints are exerciſed with. And then give you ſome ſhort application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In times of Humiliation for ſin: When the Soul hath lien Bedrid in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, been overwhelmed in the depths of Humilation for ſin, and hath been
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64789:156"/>even broken and ſhattered in peeces with fear and conſternation of Spirit for ſin: An appearance of Chriſt to the Soul now, is full of comfort. When CHRIST ſhall come Riding upon the wings of a Promiſe into the Soul: When he ſhall come, diſplaying all his Glory; the Riches of his Grace; And ſhall ſay to the Soul; as he did to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note> —<hi>The LORD, The LORD GOD Mercifull, and Gracious, pardoning iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tranſgeſsions and ſins,</hi> &amp;c. Exod. 34.6. Oh! It is beyond my power to expreſſe, or of us All to conceive, How much the Soul is now Enamored on him: How much the Soul is now Revived.</p>
            <p>As before in this condition he appeared as a Ghoſt to terrifie: ſo now he appears as a Saviour to comfort them. And <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> makes this appearance of Chriſt to anſwer to their former apprehenſion of him. The truth of this that I have ſaid, you may read in Job 33.10. To the 27. ver. Where the Soul is in a ſad condition for ſin, in the 19.20.21.22. And upon the diſcovery of Chriſt, how is the Soul raiſed? 24.25.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Times of Temptation. When
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64789:157"/>a poor ſoul hath been long buffetted with Satan, and Held down with his bloody Carnall reaſonings. When the Soul hath been long on the ſtormy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ſea of temptations: And CHRIST ſhall at laſt apear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the ſtrong-man, Rebuking the ſtorme, overcoming Satan: Oh! who can expreſſe how welcome ſuch a ſight of CHRIST: Such an Appearance of CHRIST is to the Soul! This is a Reſurrection from the dead, you have it typyfied in <hi>Abraham</hi> who after the battell with the four Kings, <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi> comes to meet him with Bread and wine, ſtrength and comfort, which ſhewes us, that our <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> after all our ſpirituall battels are over will meet us with the choyceſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. This is that he promiſeth, Rev. 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh I will give the hidden Manna and the white Stone and a name in it which no man knoweth but he that hath it.</hi> As after Chriſts temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were over, the Angels came to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to him, ſo will Chriſt after all our conflicts, meet us with refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proportion our Comforts to our Conflicts.</p>
            <pb n="287" facs="tcp:64789:157"/>
            <p>In times of deſertion: when a man hath been upon the black ſeas of deſertion, and hath long laboured under the ſad ſenſe of Gods withdrawments: and at laſt Chriſt comes in, walking upon the ſea, breaking the dark and thick cloud, and ſhining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule: who can now expreſſe the heats, warmths, revivings, that this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance yeilds to the ſoule! Oh, the claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings! the imbracings! the loves! that paſſe betwixt the ſoule and Chriſt. Will you ſee this ſet downe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. Chriſt had withdrawne himſelfe for a ſeaſon. And ah! then what ſadneſſe! All the world was like a feaſt without an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: a Paradiſe without a Tree of Life. She makes inquiſition; Heares not of him; Runs to Ordinances, and would be glad to have the leaſt ſtarre of direction to carry her to him, in this ſad condition while ſhe is in the purſuit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>At laſt Chriſt appeares to her ſoule. And read there, how her heart was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,—<hi>I have found him whom my ſoule lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; I held him, and would not let him go, untill I had brought him into my mothers houſe.</hi>—The like you have of <hi>Iob,</hi> he had been a long time in a dark and deſerted condition, you may read his complaints:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64789:158"/>every Chapter, Verſe, &amp;c. is but the ſad pauſes and pathyes, the afflicted breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his ſoule. At laſt God appeares, and who can tell his joy? who is able to expreſſe the raviſhments of his heart? I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eyes ſee thee.—And certainely his heart was filled with as much ſoule-advancements as ſelf-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Iob</hi> 45.5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the time of outward trouble: when we are in ſome ſad, heavie, &amp; cloſe affliction, when we are upon beds of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when in priſon, when in dangers: Oh! then a viſit of Chriſt in priſon, a diſcovery of Chriſt in danger, a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Chriſt upon the bed of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; it is worth a world to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>So it was to the Three Children in the fiery furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.24, 25. When the fourth appeared, the preſence of whom was like the Son of God. So it was here to the Diſciples, when they were in this danger on the ſea, and Chriſt appeared to them: none can expreſſe how their hearts leaped for joy; what heights of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings after thoſe depths of trouble.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the appearance of Chriſt in any ſad condition is ſuch a comfort to the ſoule.</p>
            <pb n="289" facs="tcp:64789:158"/>
            <p>It is true alſo of the preſence of Chriſt, though there be not the appearance of Chriſt. The preſence of Chriſt in grace, though not in comfort. His preſence doth ſupport, ſtrengthen, quicken, incourage. 1. Becauſe he is a Saviour. 2. A powerfull Saviour. 3. A mercifull and loving Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> What incouragement ſhould this be to Gods people? in the middeſt of the ſaddeſt calamities Chriſt is preſent with you, <hi>Iſay</hi> 41.10.—<hi>Feare not, I am with thee, be not diſmaied, for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will helpe thee; yea,</hi> I <hi>will uphold thee with the righthand of my righteouſneſse.</hi> So againe, <hi>Iſay</hi> 43.2, 3, 4. <hi>when thou pſſeſt through the fire,</hi> I <hi>will be with thee that the fire ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure thee; and when thou paſſeſt through the water,</hi> I <hi>will be with thee, that the water ſhall not drowne thee.</hi>—This was <hi>Moſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>Jeremiahs, Joſephs;</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was caſt into priſon, but God was with him, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 39.21. Who would not be in <hi>Joſephs</hi> priſon for <hi>Joſephs</hi> companion?</p>
            <p>He that was with <hi>Joſeph</hi> in priſon, with <hi>David</hi> in the wilderneſſe, with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the ſtockes, with <hi>Daniel</hi> in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64789:159"/>den, with the <hi>Three Children</hi> in the fire, <hi>Ionah</hi> in the ſea; he will be with us, by his grace, by his comforts, by his ſupports, by his Spirit; Hee will be with thee to beare thee up, and deliver thee out of thy ſaddeſt conditions. Oh! Let us then beg the preſence of God. Oh beg! Never more cauſe to beg. Say with <hi>Ieremy,</hi>—Why art thou like to a way fairing man that turnes aſide to tarry for a night. Say with the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Abide with us, abide with us, the day is gone, and the night is approaching, the night of trouble, the night of afflictions.</p>
            <p>Our conditions are very ſad. We may cry with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. <hi>Oh God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance, thy holy Temple have they deſiled, they have laid Ieruſalem on heaps.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9. Which ſpeaks our times to the full. And therefore now beg the preſence of Chriſt in our Councels, in our Armies, in our Preparations, in our goings out. We have a promiſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. That Chriſt will be with us alway to the worlds end. Turne this promiſe into a prayer.</p>
            <p>And as you deſire Chriſt to Preſent himſelf to you: ſo doe you preſent your ſelves for Chriſt, as you deſire he ſhould
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64789:159"/>appear for you; ſo doe you appeare for him.</p>
            <p>Thus wee have briefly paſſed over three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The way Chriſt takes to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The incouragement it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ground of it.</p>
            <p>We come to the fourth and laſt thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Time, and that's expreſt in the firſt word, <hi>[Straitway.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[But Straitway.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> So full of Bowells is Chriſt to his Church, that he cannot long brook his people in trouble, when
<note n="b" place="margin">Dominus non deeſt cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantibus. Guid.</note> they cry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> exerciſed his Brethren for a time: but he could not hold out long. His Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells yearned. <hi>I am Ioſeph.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Non diu Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ſuos Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus per erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metu vexari ſed ſtatim vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; verbo ſuo ſeſe illis revelat, &amp; anxios conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur. Muſc.</note> So heere Chriſt,—Though he had exerciſed, them yet now he can hold no longer, <hi>It is I.</hi> I that am your Saviour.</p>
            <p>The Mother may hide her ſelf for a time from the child: But when the child cries, ſhe can ſtay no longer. God hath more Bowells to his People, then a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Childe. <hi>Can a Mother forget her child,—Though ſhee ſhould, yet I will not forget thee.</hi> Indeed he ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears long to them in trouble. — <hi>How
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64789:160"/>long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever! How long wilt thou hide thy face from mee!</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſo the ſouls under the Altar, <hi>How long Lord, holy, and true?</hi> But yet though it ſeeme long to us, it is not long. It is called but a day of trouble, an hour of Temptation, nay a moment, yea and a ſmall moment,

               <note n="d" place="margin">Nubeculae cito tranſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.</note> 
               <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forfaken thee.</hi> It ſeems long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are in trouble; Sad houres are long houres, or it ſeems long to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we miſtake the day, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but we Antedate the Promiſes, as we poſt-date duties. We do as the man in the Goſpel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promiſe is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a 100 daies hence, we take our pen &amp; write downe fifty, this Spirit it ſeems <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, they thought God deferred, when he did not deferr; it was they which did haſten. And therefore ſaith <hi>Haba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuck, Though it tarry, wait for it;</hi> that is, though it tarry to us; for it followes, in reſpect of the certainty of Gods decree, it ſhall come, and not tarry. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, though God exerciſes us, yet full of Bowells hee is, that hee will not ſtay long. And this</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he loves us.</p>
            <pb n="293" facs="tcp:64789:160"/>
            <p n="2">2. He intends to Exerciſe, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He intends our Praiſes. Gods end is deliverance in all.</p>
            <p>Indeed he may ſeem to ſtay, for many Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To exerciſe our Graces. Firſt, Our Faith, in depending, beleeving. 2. Our Hope, in expectation of him. 3. Our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in waiting on him. 4. The Grace of Prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To diſcover Corruption: To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what is in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To fit us for Mercy.</p>

            <p>The Rod of the wicked ſhall not alway lie on the back of the Righteous.</p>
            <p>It is as well Gods deſire to come in with Mercy, as yours to expect it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>The Lord waits, that he may be gracious to you,</hi> — You wait when God will, and God waites when he may; when Mercy may be moſt welcome, and deliverance moſt glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. This may rejoyce the Church in her ſaddeſt condition; When we are in Trouble, and the Enemies vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſay with the Church. <hi>Micah.</hi> 7.7,
